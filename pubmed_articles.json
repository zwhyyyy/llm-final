    "abstract": "Tissue-like bioelectronics have emerged as practical, user-friendly and unobtrusive systems for seamless bidirectional integration with the human body. Two-dimensional materials, being led by the prototypical graphene, uniquely fit the task of creating ultrathin and functional interfaces with biological matter. In this Perspective, we comprehensively discuss 2D materials and their electrical, optical, environmental and mechanical properties relevant to bioelectronics. We present examples of 2D material-based bioelectronic devices for tissue interfacing (skintronics) and organ interfacing (organtronics). Importantly, we provide a roadmap for the future development of the field and highlight associated challenges yet to be solved.",

    "abstract": "Although perceived vaccine efficacy is strongly associated with vaccination behavior, little is known about how well laypeople understand what vaccine efficacy rates mean. Three experiments (N=3402) explored errors in how laypeople process numerical information about vaccine efficacy rates and examined the effects of three tutorial interventions designed to bring lay perceptions in line with normative efficacy calculations. Findings indicate that responses to questions about efficacy rate tend to align with normatively correct calculations, whereas responses to questions about the rate of infections indicate an incorrect calculation whereby the post-vaccination risk of infection is assumed to be the efficacy rate subtracted from 100%. Both quantitative and conceptual tutorial interventions helped participants calculate efficacy rates that were more aligned with the normatively correct values and infection rates that were less aligned with the incorrect values, particularly when participants had higher numeracy levels or responded with numeric inputs rather than choices between options.",

    "abstract": "Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a prevalent endocrine condition that presents with significant clinical symptoms. Ectopic adenomas commonly occur in the tracheo-esophageal groove, thymus, intrathyroidal, and mediastinum. While mediastinal ectopic adenomas are frequently observed, pericardial ectopic adenomas are only documented in case reports in the literature. We present a 65-year-old female patient who had persistent PHPT and underwent re-sternotomy and excision of a pericardial ectopic parathyroid adenoma. The typical treatment for PHPT has generally been conventional bilateral neck exploration without preoperative imaging. Conventional bilateral neck exploration has decreased in popularity because of the rise in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) procedure. The use of MIP is prevalent in surgical procedures, and it is crucial to have precise preoperative localization. Due to the ectopic localization of certain parathyroid adenomas, they are regarded as an important cause of the failure of primary surgery. Hence, particularly when dealing with persistent and recurrent PHPT, modern imaging techniques like 4D CT enhance the efficacy of surgical interventions. Therefore, particularly in cases of ectopic parathyroid adenomas located in the mediastinum, it is important to consider the possibility that if the adenoma cannot be found after surgery, it may be located in the pericardial region.",

In this book chapter, we highlighted the microtubule-associated protein Tau, exploring its structural diversity and its distinct isoforms. It is an intrinsically disordered protein which lacks three-dimensional structure that are defined by their vast structural segments that undergo rapid and prolonged conformational alterations. It has not been possible to analyze the structure of disordered proteins since they often have different conformations and are very flexible. Tau proteins comprise various domains that significantly participate in physiology in neurons, including stabilizing microtubule structure and dynamics and axonal cargo transport. In its physiological state, Tau interacts with various molecules and proteins. By various post-translational modifications at specific sites in Tau protein, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation. Tau protein undergo pathological structural confirmation by hyperphosphorylation, forming insoluble oligomers, and developing as paired helical filaments.

    "abstract": "Polyamines are regulatory metabolites with key roles in transcription, translation, cell signalling and autophagy<sup>1</sup>. They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels<sup>2</sup>. Polyamines have been linked to pain showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models<sup>3</sup>. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. In undertaking a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK-Biobank we found significant association with variants mapping to the <i>SLC45A4</i> gene locus. In the mouse nervous system SLC45A4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron sub-types within the dorsal root ganglion including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, whilst the cryo-EM structure reveals a novel regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat and algogen induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings thus establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a new target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.",

Here, we report the biochemical characterization of <i>Thermococcus kodakarensis</i> Nat10 (TkNat10), an RNA acetyltransferase involved in archaeal thermotolerance. We demonstrate that TkNat10's catalytic activity is critical for <i>T. kodakarensis</i> fitness at elevated temperatures. Unlike eukaryotic homologs, TkNat10 exhibits robust stand-alone activity, modifying diverse RNA substrates in a temperature, ATP, and acetyl-CoA-dependent manner. Transcriptome-wide analysis reveals TkNat10 preferentially modifies unstructured RNAs containing a 5'-CCG-3' consensus sequence. Using a high-throughput mutagenesis approach, we define sequence and structural determinants of TkNat10 substrate recognition. We find TkNat10 can be engineered to use non-native acyl-CoA donors, providing insight into its cofactor specificity. Finally, we demonstrate TkNat10's utility for site-specific acetylation of RNA oligonucleotides, enabling analysis of ac4C-dependent RNA-protein interactions. Our findings establish a framework for understanding archaeal RNA acetylation and a new tool for studying the functional consequences of ac4C in diverse RNA contexts.",

Their respective oncogenic mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment options are reviewed. It is important for the clinician to recognize when tumors of the conjunctiva may be infection-associated. A detailed history and exam are the most important first step in diagnosis; this may be supplemented by tools such as high-resolution optical coherence tomography. For some tumors, the specific causative agent may influence treatment options and outcomes. For others, data suggest the infectious agent does not influence treatment or outcomes, but it is important nonetheless to be aware as further research on these tumors continues. Additionally, there is exciting research investigating novel and minimally invasive diagnostic and treatment options for conjunctival tumors, including treatments that target the infectious agent directly.",

    "abstract": "Making plans for upcoming actions is a computationally demanding process. To mitigate these demands, individuals can build extensive internal models of their environment-states, actions, and their sequential relationships-that allow for plans to be developed with minimal computational costs. Initially, these models reflect elaborate networks of learned associative relationships, which can be used to generate plans for reward through more iterative computations such as trajectory sampling. After sufficient experience, compressed forms of these models can efficiently capture long-range sequential structure, allowing them to be used for rapid planning even in pursuit of novel or changing rewards. Here, we review recent work on the multitude of representations that can support different forms of planning. We discuss how <i>cognitive graphs</i>, a framework with roots in both cognitive psychology and computer science, can provide a unifying view of these representations and their relationships to one another. Conceptualizing internal models as forms of graphs situates them on a spectrum where different kinds of structured sequences can be queried to support both planning and the formation of iteratively more compressed predictive representations. We discuss how each of these kinds of cognitive graphs are created during learning, and used to transfer and generalize knowledge across environments. Taken together, this review highlights the significant impact that the various associative structures of memory have on planning.",

Next, 57 qualitative studies were selected to evaluate the ethical concerns and solutions in providing healthcare and treatment for older generations. Two independent researchers screened and assessed the studies, and the results were reported. Our findings showed that the main concern of policymakers and healthcare planners should be observance of principles such as autonomy, dignity, and fair and balanced distribution of medical resources while not prioritizing others over older adults due to their age.

Short-term planning is more challenging than medium- and long-term planning because it deals with daily challenges with block model changes, mining cut polygons variation, which increases the gap between medium- and long-term plans for each material to be mined. Short-term mine planning teams are expected to identify and manage potential risks to mitigate them, and eventually achieve the long-term objective of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV). Very few studies have identified the problems that exist in short-term mine planning and provided technical solutions to overcome them for open-pit mines. One of the complexities associated with short-term planning is the creation of polygons or mining cuts by clustering before optimizing and scheduling the plan to reduce the computational expense of mine planning models. The primary objective of this study is to review the latest papers describing short-term mine planning challenges and technical solutions proposed to optimize mine planning for open-pit mines.",

Moreover, vitreous LB proves highly effective in diagnosing vitreoretinal lymphoma, exhibiting greater sensitivity than traditional cytopathological methods. This noninvasive approach not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also holds potential for guiding biologically targeted therapies, showcasing the ongoing advancements in LB technology poised to redefine and revolutionize the field. These findings offer valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies in ocular malignancies.",

    "title": "Selective Classification Under Distribution Shifts.",
    "abstract": "In selective classification (SC), a classifier abstains from making predictions that are likely to be wrong to avoid excessive errors. To deploy imperfect classifiers-either due to intrinsic statistical noise of data or for robustness issue of the classifier or beyond-in high-stakes scenarios, SC appears to be an attractive and necessary path to follow. Despite decades of research in SC, most previous SC methods still focus on the ideal statistical setting only, i.e., the data distribution at deployment is the same as that of training, although practical data can come from the wild. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an SC framework that takes into account distribution shifts, termed <i>generalized selective classification</i>, that covers label-shifted (or out-of-distribution) and covariate-shifted samples, in addition to typical in-distribution samples, <i>the first of its kind</i> in the SC literature. We focus on non-training-based confidence-score functions for generalized SC on deep learning (DL) classifiers, and propose two novel margin-based score functions. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we show that our proposed score functions are more effective and reliable than the existing ones for generalized SC on a variety of classification tasks and DL classifiers.

    "abstract": "To determine (1) how parental childhood disadvantage is associated with parent-to-child financial transfers for schooling and other unspecified purposes and (2) whether the association holds when parental socioeconomic status (years of education, family income, wealth) is considered. Cumulative inequality theory posits that early life disadvantage may not only adversely affect one's resource accumulation across the life course, but it may also shape one's ability to provide assistance to offspring. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics were used to estimate zero-inflated negative binomial regression models to predict the amount of parent-to-child transfers (<i>N</i> = 2364 for school transfers, <i>N</i> = 3618 for other transfers), controlling for parents' and children's sociodemographic factors. Childhood disadvantage score (0 as reference, 1, 2, 3, 4+) was constructed using 13 items that reflect the economic, psychosocial, environmental, and health domains of early life. The associations of each domain with financial transfers were also estimated. Parents with 4+ disadvantages gave about $2200 less for schooling. Economic and environmental disadvantage lessened levels of school transfers, while environmental disadvantage decreased the odds of being a non-provider of other transfers. The disparity in transfer amounts generally narrowed when the mediating role of parental socioeconomic status was accounted for. Higher education has become one of the major mechanisms through which class stratification, social inequality, and health disparities ensue. Educational outcomes among current cohorts of young adults could have been shaped by the preceding generation's childhood through intergenerational exchanges.",

    "title": "Neoadjuvant systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: challenges and opportunities-a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers with high mortality rate worldwide. Surgical resection, liver transplantation (LT), and thermal ablation are primary curative methods for early-stage HCC. However, the high recurrence rate following surgical intervention is the primary factor contributing to the unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, the critical aspect in improving the overall survival of HCC lies in reducing the postoperative recurrence rate. This review is aimed at summarizing the current evidence base regarding the safety and efficacy of systemic therapy administered in the neoadjuvant context for patients with resectable HCC. Furthermore, we will offer a perspective on the potential future trajectories of systemic therapy as a neoadjuvant modality in the management of HCC. We searched PubMed with terms: hepatocellular carcinoma, neoadjuvant, preoperative, chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, targeted therapy, systemic therapy, immunotherapy. Relevant ongoing clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov are included. In the context of resectable solid organ cancers, neoadjuvant therapy is frequently administered to delay disease progression, ensure appropriate patient selection, reduce tumor burden and potentially eradicate micrometastases prior to surgical procedures. In recent years, the advancements in systemic therapy for advanced HCC, especially with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy combination, have significantly contributed to notable improvements in overall survival. These breakthroughs have prompted the exploration and implementation of systemic therapy in the setting of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for HCC. In this review, we aim to briefly summarize the current available evidence on the safety and efficacy of systemic therapy in neoadjuvant settings designed to improve the outcome of curative-intent liver resection or LT for patients with resectable HCC. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and issues that need to be further clarified before widespread adoption of neoadjuvant therapies, providing an outlook on future directions of systemic therapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HCC. Neoadjuvant therapy involving immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, seems to exhibit the most promising characteristics of preventing recurrence and improving long-term survival of HCC patients following curative hepatectomy or LT, especially when combined with anti-angiogenic therapies and locoregional therapy. Further research is needed to identify suitable candidates, predictive biomarkers, optimal regimens for neoadjuvant therapy, and ideal timing for surgery.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, alarming trends in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have grown into some of the most important health concerns worldwide. The present research attempts to address the controversial approaches to the practical function of medical ethics while critically reviewing the main concepts of ethical considerations in NCD prevention literature. After refining the searched documents, we integrated related concepts and research, particularly emphasizing ethical considerations in NCD management. All four functional areas of NCD prevention (general health policymaking, social interventional, primary prevention, and secondary prevention) are affected by parallel associated factors of health determinants: environmental modification, lifestyle improvement and physiological characteristics, respectively. In addition to the practical aspects of implementing a response to NCDs, a variety of ethical considerations should be taken into account. For instance, general policies, equity in care, interventional programs, and clinical/research data protection. A comprehensive, holistic approach considering all the involved parties can accommodate the wide spectrum of needs and continuum of management for NCDs. Creating an ethical procedure structure in public health systems can provide insight into managing the challenges posed by NCDs to health systems and assist in systematically confronting ethical problems in the management of NCDs.",

Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to explore the current knowledge in this process and map the directions for future research. The present review was based on the five-step framework of Arksey and O'Malley. Eligible articles were examined using descriptive analysis of studies on the characteristics and psychometrics of the tools for professional identity assessment and their underlying theories. After an extensive search, 9,924 studies were identified, 162 of which were selected for full-text review, and finally, 17 articles qualified for inclusion in the study. For the most part, the target group consisted of studies on nursing and medical students. In 14 of the included studies, tools and psychometric properties were mentioned. Most professional identity assessment tools were designed or developed based on identity theories, particularly the social identity theory and Kagan's constructive-developmental theory, which were used more often than others. This scoping review will help researchers to choose or develop reliable and valid tools under clear conceptual and theoretical frameworks to assess the formation and development of professional identity in health professions education.",

    "abstract": "Total serum magnesium concentration is rarely determined in clinical practice. Moreover, there is currently no standardised and evidence-based reference range for serum magnesium. The aim of this communication is to propose a reference range that is evidence-based and reflects the preventive potential of optimal magnesium levels. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database using the terms \"serum magnesium\", \"reference interval\", \"reference range\", and \"hypomagnesemia\". Additionally, citations from relevant studies were consulted. There is considerable variation between laboratories with regards to the lower limit of magnesium in serum. The majority of limits are considerably below the 0.85 mmol/L (2.07 mg/dL) threshold proposed by expert groups. The rationale for this limit is that lower levels are associated with an increased risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. To prevent health risks associated with low magnesium levels, the lower limit of serum magnesium should be raised to 0.85 mmol/L and standardised between laboratories. At least, laboratory reports should note that levels below 0.85 mmol/L are associated with an increased risk of disease. Furthermore, the determination of serum magnesium should be afforded the same importance in routine laboratory diagnostics as the determination of other electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are prevalent among patients with heart failure (HF) and may trigger acute exacerbations of the condition. However, the causal relationship between sleep disturbances and HF remains uncertain. This study aimed to explore the association and potential causal relationship between sleep disturbances and HF. Observational study: NHANES data (2005-2008) involving 10,432 participants. Sleep disturbances defined as insomnia, sleep disorders, difficulty falling asleep, trouble sleeping, and nocturnal awakening. Mendelian randomization (MR) study: Genetic variants linked to sleeplessness were obtained from GWAS datasets. MR two-sample analysis was conducted using summary statistics from sleeplessness and HF GWASs. After full adjustment, the association between insomnia and HF remained significant, with an OR of 5.10 (1.81-14.33, <i>p</i> = 0.003). After full adjustment, the association between sleep disorder and HF remained significant, with an OR of 3.51 (1.67-7.39; <i>p</i> = 0.002). The IVW method provided evidence supporting a causal association between sleeplessness and HF (OR = 1.535, SE = 0.177, <i>p</i> = 0.016). MR-Egger analysis demonstrated a causal association between sleeplessness and HF (OR = 3.333, SE = 0.493, <i>p</i> = 0.023). Our observational study may be influenced by unaddressed confounding factors; however, Mendelian randomization helps mitigate the bias and confounding commonly found in non-genetic observational research. Our study identified a correlation between sleep disturbances and HF, potentially suggesting a causal relationship. Addressing sleep disturbances may be a key strategy in reducing the risk of HF.",

Highly branched polymers, dendrimers were also seen to be effective Tau and AD therapeutics as drug-delivery systems and on their own. Metal complexes and metal nanoparticles also showed success against AD. Synthesis of a bifunctional compound that was an effective chelating agent for Cu, useful against Tau and Amyloid-β (Aβ) and was catalysed by excess Cu metal present in association with Aβ was also done.

A literature search was conducted PubMed, MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and meeting abstract libraries (International Gynecological Cancer Society, Society of Gynecologic Oncology, American Society of Clinical Oncology) from 1994, the year of the first published laparoscopic clinical study in ovarian cancer, to May 2024. Studies that compared minimally invasive surgery with laparotomy for staging of ovarian cancer and reported perioperative or survival outcomes data were included. Single-arm studies, case studies, meeting abstracts, and studies involving borderline tumors, fertility-sparing surgery, or management of recurrent disease were excluded. Three authors independently screened citations for relevance and inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessed the risk of bias of individual studies using the methodologic index for nonrandomized studies criteria for nonrandomized studies. From a total of 2,777 identified citations, 36 nonrandomized studies were included: 21 early-stage, five primary debulking for advanced stages, seven interval debulking after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and three with heterogeneous populations. No randomized studies were identified. For early-stage cancer, nine studies found no difference in progression-free survival (risk ratio [RR] 1.05, 95% CI, 1.00-1.10, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=34.7%, <i>P</i>=.151), and 12 studies found no difference in overall survival (RR 1.00, 95% CI, 0.98-1.03, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=49.7%, <i>P</i>=.025). For primary debulking of advanced disease, rate of optimal debulking (five studies) (RR 1.11, 95% CI, 1.00-1.25, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=41.5%, <i>P</i>=.144) slightly favored minimally invasive techniques. For interval debulking, there was no difference in rates of optimal debulking (five studies) (RR 1.03, 95% CI, 0.96-1.11, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=54.6%, <i>P</i><.051) between the two surgical modalities. The inclusion of observational studies in this analysis with a fair amount of bias warrants caution in the interpretation of the findings. However, minimally invasive surgery may offer some perioperative advantages over laparotomy and may be an acceptable alternative for selected patients. For early-stage disease, there was no difference in survival outcomes between minimally invasive surgery and laparotomy. For those with advanced disease, rates of optimal debulking were similar.

    "abstract": "After nearly a half of a century of work to develop effective approaches to prevent sexual violence, there is still considerable progress to be made. Prevention approaches are often universal in nature despite recognition of the need for targeted approaches. Behavioral outcomes are not routinely assessed in evaluations. Further, effective prevention programs are not widely disseminated, and some programs being implemented have not sustained evaluation. Closing the research to practice gap is a critical next step for the field. This commentary discusses how implementation science theories and methods can help to advance the development, evaluation and dissemination of evidence-based sexual assault prevention approaches. Implementation science principles and concepts can advance the development of sexual assault prevention programs by prioritizing stakeholder engagement, systematically adapting evidence-based programs, and designing for dissemination and sustainability. The evaluation of sexual assault prevention approaches by prioritizing hybrid designs that move beyond efficacy and effectiveness trials, attending to the factors that influence implementation outcomes, and better understanding the processes through which fidelity is achieved in program implementation. Implementation science can also be utilized to facilitate dissemination and de-implementation of programs, understand the barriers to uptake, and facilitate scale up. Integration of implementation science principles and concepts into efforts to develop, evaluate and disseminate sexual assault prevention programs is an important for speeding progress in sexual assault prevention, towards the goal of ultimately reducing rates of sexual violence.",

    "abstract": "Managing pheochromocytoma during pregnancy presents significant challenges due to the absence of well-established guidelines. Early detection during prenatal care, together with timely medical and surgical interventions, is crucial for achieving favorable maternal and fetal outcomes. This report presents the case of a 35-year-old nulliparous woman with bilateral pheochromocytoma who became pregnant between the first and second stages of adrenalectomy. Preoperative management included α-adrenergic blockade and hydration, which was successfully implemented despite the patient being normotensive. The patient underwent a cortical-sparing tumor resection during the second trimester without complications and subsequently delivered a healthy full-term infant through normal labor. This case demonstrates that preoperative α-adrenergic blockade remains the recommended approach for managing pheochromocytoma during pregnancy, even in normotensive patients. Additionally, laparoscopic cortical-sparing adrenalectomy appears to be an effective surgical option for minimizing the risk of long-term adrenal insufficiency in cases of bilateral lesions.",

The descriptors used were \"Oral Health Literacy\", \"Health Literacy\", \"Literacy in Dentistry\", \"Oral Health\", \"Oral Condition\", \"Dental Caries\", \"Early Childhood Caries\", \"Children\", \"Child, Preschool\", \"Infant\", \"Parents\" and \"Parenting\". Scientific articles published in English, Portuguese and Spanish between 2013 and 2023 were included. Likewise, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized clinical trials were included. Literature reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded. 147 articles were identified. Then, two trained researchers selected the publications through reading titles, abstracts and full texts. Finally, 14 articles were included. The articles included in this review defined OHL as an important predictor of oral health care, and the REALD-30 was the most used instrument. Furthermore, most of the articles reported the association between low level parents' OHL and their children's poor oral health status. <b>C</b>. There is an association between the low level of parents' OHL and the poor oral health status of their children. Furthermore, the socioeconomic level of the family is related to children's oral health care, which leads parents, due to lack of knowledge and lack of resources, to adopt harmful attitudes towards their children.",

    "title": "Introducing the ethical cycle model for resolving ethical conflicts in medical practice: addressing challenges in treating pandemic patients.",
    "abstract": "Ethical dilemmas are among the most important ethical problems in medicine. With the advent of COVID-19, the moral problems of physicians have taken on new dimensions as the specific features of this disease pose additional ethical challenges that require particular solutions. One common way to solve ethical dilemmas is to use ethical decision making models. One of the most recent models in ethics of technology is the \"ethical cycle\" developed by Ibo van de Poel. By describing and comparing several models, this paper examines the application of the ethical cycle to physicians' ethical problems and medical ethics. This model can help solve complex problems in consultations and ethics committee meetings because it is comprehensive and covers various aspects of the discussion. In this model, first the ethical problem is formulated and analyzed and then the potential options for action are proposed. Subsequently, by referring to ethical theories and professional codes of conduct in the medical field, as well as applying the method of \"reflective equilibrium,\" an ethical decision is reached. This decision is specific to each case and may not necessarily be the best solution for other individuals or situations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to review literature on integrating psychological well-being and self-care behaviors into the university undergraduate nursing education curriculum. Burnout has been recognized as a key contributing factor to nursing shortages. Interventions aiming to improve coping skills and reduce stress have been shown to be effective. Learning coping skills during nursing education would benefit students greatly during their study and beyond. The literature review searched four electronic databases including CINAHL, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science to select relevant peer-reviewed articles. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Most showed that building resilience and improving self-care behaviors have positive effects on nursing students' psychological well-being. To enhance coping skills, reduce stress, and improve well-being in nursing students, university nursing programs should integrate psychological well-being and self-care behaviors into their nursing curricula.",

    "abstract": "The classical singularity theorems of R. Penrose and S. Hawking from the 1960s show that, given a pointwise energy condition (and some causality as well as initial assumptions), spacetimes cannot be geodesically complete. Despite their great success, the theorems leave room for physically relevant improvements, especially regarding the classical energy conditions as essentially any quantum field theory necessarily violates them. While singularity theorems with weakened energy conditions exist for worldline integral bounds, so-called worldvolume bounds are in some cases more applicable than the worldline ones, such as the case of some massive free fields. In this paper, we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a-potentially very negative-global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking-type singularity theorem is proved. Finally, we apply the theorem to a cosmological scenario proving past geodesic incompleteness in cases where the worldline theorem was inconclusive.",

This study explores the capacities of teaching hospitals in providing such care. Although most programs can manage health- and life-threatening situations, there are significant regional differences in service limitations and colleague support. For example, compared with faculty members in programs in protective states, those in restrictive states are more likely to report restrictions on first-trimester care (69.4% vs 10.9%, <i>P</i><.001) and second-trimester care (75.0% vs 12.7%, <i>P</i><.001).

In addition, children with SLD are known to have problems with language. The importance of language to social cognition is well-established in research with children with typical and atypical development. Thus, we review literature that investigates language and social cognition in children with SLD compared with their peers. We also explore the link between language and social cognition in children with typical and atypical language development. Review of this literature suggests that the language deficits associated with SLD put children with SLD at a risk for deficits in social cognitive skill. The literature also points toward a critical need for early identification of SLD and research investigating social perspective taking in individuals with SLD across the lifespan. Last, we propose that clinicians should assess language before diagnosing and implementing intervention for the academic and social difficulties that children and adolescents with SLD experience.",

We thoroughly searched Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus for relevant keywords and conducted this narrative review which explores the diagnosis of ACV-resistant HSK, and discusses alternative treatment strategies, reports previous cases. Treatment strategies for ACV-resistant HSK include increasing ACV doses, switching to oral valacyclovir (VACV), and using topical antivirals such as foscarnet (FOS), ganciclovir (GCV), trifluridine, and cidofovir. Debridement of lesions and emerging antiviral agents are also considered. The review emphasizes the importance of diagnosing cytomegalovirus in ACV-resistant cases and explores new treatments like helicase primase inhibitors and BX795. Insights from the authors' clinical experience contribute to understanding ACV-resistant HSK and provide valuable guidance for clinicians managing this condition. HSK is a leading cause of ocular complications in HSV infections, potentially causing visual impairment. ACV has been the primary treatment, but rising ACV resistance necessitates alternative strategies. Options include increased ACV doses, oral VACV, topical FOS, GCV, interferon, and lesion debridement. Clinicians should also explore emerging treatments for ACV-resistant HSK.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-assisted drug design is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry. Effective molecular features are crucial for accurate machine learning predictions, and advanced mathematics plays a key role in designing these features. Persistent homology theory, which equips topological invariants with persistence, provides valuable insights into molecular structures. The standard homology theory is based on a differential rule for the boundary operator that satisfies <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <msup><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow> </msup> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0</mn></math> . Our recent work has extended this rule by employing Mayer homology with generalized differentials that satisfy <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <msup><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow> <mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow> </msup> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0</mn></math> for <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>N</mi> <mo>≥</mo> <mn>2</mn></math> , leading to the development of persistent Mayer homology (PMH) theory and richer topological information across various scales. In this study, we utilize PMH to create a novel multiscale topological vectorization for molecular representation, offering valuable tools for descriptive and predictive analyses in molecular data and machine learning prediction. Specifically, benchmark tests on established protein-ligand datasets, including PDBbind-v2007, PDBbind-v2013, and PDBbind-v2016, demonstrate the superior performance of our Mayer homology models in predicting protein-ligand binding affinities.",

A scoping review following the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute and the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews was conducted in search of studies published from 2000 onwards on the influence of spiritual interventions on chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus and cancer. Of the 1,564 studies identified, 26 experimental or quasi-experimental studies published between 2000 and 2022 were eligible, covering eight modalities of spiritual intervention and a total population of 3,103 participants. The influence of spirituality on cardiovascular diseases was addressed in 16.0% of those studies; on diabetes mellitus, in 11.5%; and on cancer, in 73.0%. No results were found relating to respiratory diseases. Spiritual care was found to have positive effects on the physical, mental, and spiritual health of individuals with chronic illnesses. It is suggested that specific modalities of intervention be studied for associations with participants' spirituality; this important object of investigation may afford the possibility of enhancing gains by these interventions.",

We explored EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies comparing the rate of type 2 diabetes screening in individuals with GDM in the immediate postpartum period before hospital discharge with 4-12 weeks postpartum. Two reviewers separately identified studies, obtained data, and gauged study quality. The rate of type 2 diabetes screening was compared, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated. Five prospective and two retrospective cohort studies were identified with 2,254 individuals with GDM at 13 hospitals. Studies evaluated individuals with GDM who delivered and underwent screening for type 2 diabetes in the immediate postpartum period from May 1994 through October 2021. Four studies were from the United States, and one was from Korea, Brazil, and Iran. In these studies, testing was offered in both periods: A pooled proportion of 6.6% (95% CI, 0.23-20.5%) did not complete immediate postpartum testing before hospital discharge, and 53.0% (95% CI, 37.1-68.6%) did not complete testing at 4-12 weeks postpartum.

Outcomes assessed included overall postoperative complications, 30-day mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and total fluid administered. Ten RCTs met the inclusion criteria, of which nine (n = 1,001) were included in the quantitative synthesis after excluding studies employing outdated protocols. GDFT significantly reduced overall complication rates (risk ratios [RR] = 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-0.92]; P = 0.002), LOS (mean difference [MD] = -1.31 days [95% CI: -2.55 to -0.07]; P = 0.04), and intraoperative fluid volume (MD = -258.74 mL [95% CI: -450.86 to -66.68]; P = 0.008) compared to CFT. GDFT was also associated with lower 30-day mortality (RR = 0.42 [95% CI: 0.17-1.04]), though not statistically significant (P = 0.06). Substantial heterogeneity was noted for LOS and fluid volume. Subgroup analysis had no impact on LOS but decreased heterogeneity in intraoperative volume, with significant fluid-sparing effects only in the gastrointestinal surgery subgroup. Sensitivity analyses further revealed that the exclusion of specific studies influenced the results for mortality and LOS. In conclusion, when compared with CFT, intraoperative GDFT offers benefits in reducing postoperative complications, hospital stay, and fluid use in elderly patients. Further research is necessary to optimize protocols and address the observed heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the outcomes of asymmetric (AS) Keraring intracorneal ring segments (ICRS) implantation in patients with all types, types 2 (Duck) and 3 (Snowman) of keratoconus. The protocol for this systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023482841). From inception to December 2023, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Due to heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used for all analyses. Publication bias was evaluated using the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions tool, and sensitivity analyses included leave-one-out and Baujat methods. Meta-regression explored the effects of age, sex, and follow-up time on heterogeneous outcomes. Software R version 4.3.2 was used for statistical analysis. From 318 initial articles, 7 studies (3 prospective and 4 retrospective cohorts) met inclusion criteria, pooling 435 eyes from 365 patients across seven countries. Significant improvements were observed postoperatively for uncorrected distance visual acuity (mean differences [MD]: 0.49, confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-0.57), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) (MD: 0.18, CI: 0.07-0.29), topographic astigmatism (MD: 2.04 diopter [D], CI: 1.51-2.58 D), maximum keratometric (MD: 4.42 D, CI: 3.24-5.60 D), comatic aberration (MD: 0.56 µm, CI: 0.29-0.82 µm), refractive astigmatism (MD: -2.52 D, CI: -3.08 to -1.95 D), spherical equivalent (SE) (MD: -2.86 D, CI: -4.02 to -1.70 D), and mean keratometry (MD: 2.92 D, CI: 1.94-3.91 D). Subgroup analyses for keratoconus types 2 and 3 revealed consistent improvements across most parameters. Sensitivity analysis identified specific studies influencing heterogeneity without altering statistical significance. Meta-regression revealed associations for follow-up and male gender in SE, CDVA, and topographic astigmatism, while age showed no consistent effect. The implantation of AS Keraring ICRS was safe and effective, improving visual, topographic, and refractive parameters in patients with keratoconus of phenotype types 2, 3, and all types.",

    "title": "Social anxiety and paranoid beliefs in adolescents.",
    "abstract": "Paranoid beliefs are common in the general adolescent population. The paranoia hierarchy suggests common social evaluative concerns may develop into persecutory thoughts via ideas of reference, a milder intermediary facet of paranoia. Socially anxious concerns and paranoid beliefs co-occur in adolescent and adult groups, but the specifics of their association is not well understood. In a general population adolescent sample, we examined (a) whether social anxiety and paranoia can be differentiated, (b) patterns of co-occurrence and (c) psychosocial factors that differentiate social anxiety alone versus in combination with paranoia. An online cross-sectional survey design, recruiting UK adolescents (<i>n</i> = 604, 14-17 years), via Qualtrics. Participants were quota sampled for equal distribution on age and gender. Measurement models supported a hierarchical structure, with separate but correlated general factors of paranoia and social anxiety. This model was invariant across age groups 14-15 and 16-17 years. The largest subgroup of participants with clinically significant symptoms showed elevated social anxiety plus paranoia (21%, <i>n</i> = 124), followed by high social anxiety without paranoia (14%, <i>n</i> = 84). Paranoia without social anxiety occurred the least (7% <i>n</i> = 39). Subgroup comparisons suggested social anxiety plus paranoia was characterised by exposure to threating experiences (discrimination, bullying, adverse life events in the last 12-month), anxious attachment and high levels of distress, whereas social anxiety was more associated with feeling inferior to others, enhanced loneliness, avoidant attachment and a low sense of belonging. Social anxiety and paranoia are differentiable in adolescents. Paranoia commonly co-occurs with social anxiety, especially in those with exposure to threat environments in the last 12-month. Adolescents with social anxiety plus paranoia reported the highest levels of distress, underscoring the importance of improved understanding of this group.",

Although discrimination can be based on many individual and intersecting biases, like gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and education, in this article, we focus on discrimination rooted in ethnicity and race because of the well-founded documentation of disparities in sleep by race. Focusing primarily on adolescence and young adulthood, we integrate research linking ethnic and racial discrimination to sleep across a variety of methods and developmental time spans, ending with reflections on interventions. In so doing, we seek to advance research and encourage conversations that cross-fertilize collaborations between those with interests in discrimination, sleep, and population-level health equity.",

We provide detailed descriptions of traditional and new computerized color vision tests including the test background, the prioritized level of processing, considerations regarding whether the test is more retinal or cortical tuned, if the task/skill measured is detection, discrimination or performance in color manipulation, and when to apply the respective tests. The findings highlight the strong potential of color perception assessment in identifying early retinal changes and marking the progression of diseases, sometimes in subclinical conditions, in various ophthalmological and neurological conditions.",

The inclusion criteria were complete, available articles, published from 2001 to 2024, with a target population of non-alcoholic women in a relationship with a person sickened by alcohol use, and the outcome analyzed was the effects of this coexistence on women. The exclusion criteria were studies with marital relationships in which only women suffered from illness due to alcohol use, outcomes related to the marital relationship itself, the family and/or other family members, and/or women with other degrees of relationship, and master's and/or doctoral dissertations. Twenty-seven articles were selected for this study. They were organized into two thematic categories: 1) Life experiences of wives of men sickened by alcohol use, 2) Women and the repercussions on mental and physical health. Women in marital relationships with men sickened by alcohol are exposed to suffering, violence, and an increased risk of developing mental and physical problems.",

    "abstract": "The success of many machine learning (ML) methods depends crucially on having large amounts of labeled data. However, obtaining enough labeled data can be expensive, time-consuming, and subject to ethical constraints for many applications. One approach that has shown tremendous value in addressing this challenge is semi-supervised learning (SSL); this technique utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data during training, often with much less labeled data than unlabeled data, which is often relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain. In fact, SSL methods are particularly useful in applications where the cost of labeling data is especially expensive, such as medical analysis, natural language processing, or speech recognition. A subset of SSL methods that have achieved great success in various domains involves algorithms that integrate graph-based techniques. These procedures are popular due to the vast amount of information provided by the graphical framework. In this work, we propose an algebraic topology-based semi-supervised method called persistent Laplacian-enhanced graph MBO by integrating persistent spectral graph theory with the classical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme. Specifically, we use a filtration procedure to generate a sequence of chain complexes and associated families of simplicial complexes, from which we construct a family of persistent Laplacians. Overall, it is a very efficient procedure that requires much less labeled data to perform well compared to many ML techniques, and it can be adapted for both small and large datasets. We evaluate the performance of our method on classification, and the results indicate that the technique outperforms other existing semi-supervised algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial symbionts are critical members of many marine sponge holobionts. Some sponge-associated bacterial lineages, such as Poribacteria, SAUL, and Tethybacterales appear to have broad host ranges and associate with a diversity of sponge species, while others are more species-specific, having adapted to the niche environment of their host. Host-associated spirochete symbionts that are numerically dominant have been documented in several invertebrates including termites, starfish, and corals. However, dominant spirochete populations are rare in marine sponges, thus far only observed in <i>Clathrina clathrus</i> and various species within the Latrunculiidae family, where they are co-dominant alongside Tethybacterales symbionts. This study aimed to characterize these spirochetes and their potential role in the host sponge. Analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes from eight latrunculid sponges revealed that these unusual spirochetes are relatively recent symbionts and are phylogenetically distinct from other sponge-associated spirochetes. Functional comparative analysis suggests that the host sponge may have selected for these spirochetes due to their ability to produce terpenoids and/or possible structural contributions.",

    "abstract": "To report an uncommon complication arising from an intravitreal injection (IVI). This case describes ocular hypotony secondary to a cyclodialysis cleft following an IVI, including its management. A 68-year-old male presented with a 5-month history of persistent hypotony and vision loss in the left eye following an intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection. His history included rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the right eye and chronic central serous chorioretinopathy with macular neovascularization in the left eye, treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for 5 years. Clinical findings included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/1600 (right) and 20/150 (left), with intraocular pressure (IOP) of 16 mmHg (right) and 4 mmHg (left). Slit-lamp exam of the left eye revealed a deep pseudophakic anterior chamber, resolving vitreous hemorrhage, and chorioretinal folds without retinal breaks. Gonioscopy identified a suspected cyclodialysis cleft inferotemporally, which was confirmed by 50 MHz ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). The patient was treated with intraoperative argon laser photocoagulation (120 shots, 300 mW), targeting the cleft through a corneal incision. UBM, the next day, confirmed cleft closure and ciliary body reattachment. A transient IOP spike to 42 mmHg was medically controlled. Over the following weeks, IOP stabilized between 10 and 15 mmHg without medications, and optical coherence tomography showed resolution of chorioretinal folds and subretinal fluid. Final BCVA improved to 20/70 (left eye) and 20/800 (right eye postcataract surgery). This report underscores a rare complication of IVIs and highlights the critical role of UBM in achieving accurate diagnostic assessment.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in men over 50 years old, and radical prostatectomy, particularly via laparoscopic and robotic-assisted techniques, significantly impacts quality of life, especially in terms of erectile dysfunction. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the preservation of erectile function following robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, with a separate analysis of randomized clinical trials and non-randomized studies. This review was carried out using randomized and non-randomized studies involving adult patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered in PROSPERO. Applicable literature from PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database was analysed. The bias in randomized clinical trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and observational studies were evaluated via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.4. Our analysis included 13 studies involving 6281 patients. Comparative meta-analysis of non-randomized studies demonstrated that robotic techniques were significantly more effective in preserving erectile function at 3 months (risk difference [RD] 0.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-0.11; <i>p</i>=0.040), 6 months (RD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.17; <i>p</i>=0.006), and 12 months postoperatively (RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.10; <i>p</i>=0.002). Robotic-assisted surgery showed greater preservation of erectile function 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after radical prostatectomy. However, additional studies with meticulous methodological criteria are necessary for future analysis.",

    "abstract": "Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC) algorithms generate clouds of proposals at each step to efficiently resolve a target probability distribution <i>μ</i>. We build a rigorous foundational framework for pMCMC algorithms that situates these methods within a unified 'extended phase space' measure-theoretic formalism. Drawing on our recent work that provides a comprehensive theory for reversible single-proposal methods, we herein derive general criteria for multiproposal acceptance mechanisms that yield ergodic chains on general state spaces. Our formulation encompasses a variety of methodologies, including proposal cloud resampling and Hamiltonian methods, while providing a basis for the derivation of novel algorithms. In particular, we obtain a top-down picture for a class of methods arising from 'conditionally independent' proposal structures. As an immediate application of this formalism, we identify several new algorithms including a multiproposal version of the popular preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) sampler suitable for high- and infinite-dimensional target measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian base measure. To supplement the aforementioned theoretical results, we carry out a selection of numerical case studies that evaluate the efficacy of these novel algorithms. First, noting that the true potential of pMCMC algorithms arises from their natural parallelizability and the ease with which they map to modern high-performance computing architectures, we provide a limited parallelization study using TensorFlow and a graphics processing unit to scale pMCMC algorithms that leverage as many as 100k proposals at each step. Second, we use our multiproposal pCN algorithm (mpCN) to resolve a selection of problems in Bayesian statistical inversion for partial differential equations motivated by fluid measurement. These examples provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of mpCN for high-dimensional target distributions featuring complex geometries and multimodal structures.",

    "abstract": "Real-world decisions require understanding generalities (e.g., sorting an album collection by genre) and the ability to remember specific events (where one acquired a particular album). Discriminating between broad categories versus individual events requires contrasting features at different levels of specificity, and therefore have different representational demands. Here, we used a within-participant design to test the hypothesis that different training protocols (blocked or interleaved order) would have dissociable impacts on representation of generalities and specifics. On each trial, participants viewed a painting from one of twelve artists along with information about its unique location. Category generalization and source memory were tested immediately and after one week. Interleaving enhanced generalization, while blocking improved incidental learning of episodic details. Furthermore, category knowledge remained stable over time, whereas episodic details declined. These results indicate that interleaving and blocking optimize discrimination at different levels of specificity, with differential impacts on inferring generalities and remembering specific events.",

    "abstract": "The relationships between protein sequences, structures, and functions are determined by complex codes that scientists aim to decipher. While structures contain key information about proteins' biochemical functions, they are often experimentally difficult to obtain. In contrast, protein sequences are abundant but are a step removed from function. In this paper, we propose residue level alignment (RLA)-a self-supervised objective for aligning sequence and structure embedding spaces. By situating sequence and structure encoders within the same latent space, RLA enriches the sequence encoder with spatial information. Moreover, our framework enables us to measure the similarity between a sequence and structure by comparing their RLA embeddings. We show how RLA similarity scores can be used for binder design by selecting true binders from sets of designed binders. RLA scores are informative even when they are calculated given only the backbone structure of the binder and no binder sequence information, which simulates the information available in many early-stage binder design libraries. RLA performs similarly to benchmark methods and is orders of magnitude faster, making it a valuable new screening tool for binder design pipelines.",

    "abstract": "To assess the association between postoperative chemotherapy and the prognosis of patients with stage I ovarian clear cell carcinoma. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with stage I ovarian clear cell carcinoma who underwent surgery, including hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, between 2005 and 2019 at 11 affiliated institutions. Patients with preoperative lymph node enlargement, and those who underwent fertility-sparing surgery were excluded. The primary outcome was disease-free survival and overall survival, and was investigated as a secondary outcome. We used propensity score overlap weighting to adjust for confounding factors and estimated the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the disease-free and overall survival of patients in the control group that did not receive chemotherapy and in the platinum-based multiagent chemotherapy group during the follow-up period. In total, 283 patients (64 in the control group and 219 in the chemotherapy group) were included. Five-year disease-free survival was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.89) in the control group and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.81-0.91) in the chemotherapy group. The unadjusted HR was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.36-1.32; <i>P</i>=.26). After adjustment, patients who received chemotherapy had a significantly lower risk of recurrence than those in the control group (weighted HR for disease-free survival: 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.90; <i>P</i>=.026). There was no difference in overall survival (weighted HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27-1.69; <i>P</i>=.40). Postoperative platinum-based multiagent chemotherapy was associated with improved disease-free survival. These findings provide crucial information for shared decision-making regarding whether to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy.",

    "title": "Association of Insurance Changes With Postpartum Prescription Contraception Uptake.",
    "abstract": "To assess the association between postpartum insurance churn and postpartum contraception, with specific attention to race, ethnicity, language, and Medicaid expansion status. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey data (2012-2020) from 42 states. Insurance status, assessed more than 2 months after childbirth, was categorized as continuous insurance, insurance loss, discontinuous Medicaid-to-private, discontinuous private-to-Medicaid, continuous uninsurance, and gain of insurance. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios with 95% CIs for insurance status and use of prescription contraception methods, compared with nonprescription and no method, and adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, language, marital status, percent of federal poverty level, education, and birth year. We considered the interaction between state Medicaid expansion and insurance status and stratified analyses by race, ethnicity, and language. Of 223,430 respondents, 78.9% held continuous insurance from childbirth to more than 2 months postpartum and 10.2% lost insurance. Compared with continuous insurance, the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for prescription postpartum contraception was 0.74 (0.71-0.78) for insurance loss, 0.90 (0.84-0.97) for discontinuous private-to-Medicaid, and 1.04 (0.98-1.10) for discontinuous Medicaid-to-private. There was no evidence for an interaction between living in states with Medicaid expansion and insurance status. Of respondents without Medicaid expansion, 14.0% (95% CI, 13.6-14.3) experienced insurance loss compared with 6.8% (95% CI, 6.6-7.0) with Medicaid expansion. There was a significant interaction between insurance discontinuity and race, ethnicity, and language. Nearly half of the Hispanic Spanish-language respondents (47.5%) experienced insurance loss postpartum. Insurance loss more than 2 months postpartum was associated with decreased odds of prescription contraception. Populations that experience higher rates of insurance loss include respondents in states without Medicaid expansion and Hispanic Spanish-language respondents. Medicaid and insurance policies have important roles in enabling coverage for contraceptive access across racial and ethnic groups during the postpartum period.",

    "title": "Impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing.",
    "abstract": "Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10<sup>-12</sup>. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic-field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>pT</mtext> <mspace></mspace> <msup><mrow><mtext>s</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mn>1</mn> <mo>/</mo> <mn>2</mn></mrow> </msup> </math> -range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency-domain model incorporating the MW phase-noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>π</mi></math> pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a > 10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.",

MLC601 contains herbal components and hewan components, while MLC901 has a similar herbal composition. NeuroAiD is used to support neurologic recovery after stroke and to aid cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease. Studies show that NeuroAiD has potential in treating Alzheimer's disease and is beneficial in both local and global stroke models and in the Kortikal culture. However, there is limited bibliometric research on NeuroAiD, which is a method of collecting data from published articles to analyze developments and trends in the field of research. This research contributes significantly to the literature and helps develop more effective stroke treatment strategies. In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroaid. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, topic dendogram, and world cloud. The study investigates the potential of Neuroaid, a neuroprotective drug, for stroke prevention and cognitive function enhancement. It uses terms like \"cognition\" and \"neurogenesis\" to highlight its potential. While the study's focus may be limited, it provides valuable insights into research direction and potential areas of neuroaid for stroke treatment.",

    "title": "A Systematic Review on Prior/Postoperative Antibiotics Therapy Efficiency in Reducing Surgical Complications After Third Molar Extraction Surgery.",
    "abstract": "One of the most common dental surgeries is third molar extraction which often leads to pain and swelling after surgery. In recent years, the prophylactic antibiotics before or after surgeries have been used to reduce the risk of injuries and infection. Various researches conducted in this field have yielded contradictory results. The aim of prophylactic antibiotic treatment is to prevent possible infections and complications after surgery, while antibiotic prescription after surgeries reduces clinical symptoms such as pain. The aim of the present review study is to determine and compare the effect of antibiotic drugs before and after third molar extraction in order to reducing surgical complications. The research was conducted using electronic databases provided by PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar, with applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Accordingly, all the clinical trials published since 2000 focused on the antibiotic treatments in third molar extraction surgery were included in this review. The obtained results from 18 selected studies demonstrated that there is no statistically significant document to confirm the efficacy of antibiotics to prevent post-surgery complications such as swelling and pain after third molar extraction. Dentists should carefully consider the potential increase in bacteria's resistance to antibiotics and the possibility of side effects when prescribing them. This is because in some cases, the disadvantages may outweigh the benefits for the patient.",

We used previously validated software, <i>PallorMetrics</i>, to quantify optic disc pallor in colour fundus photographs of patients diagnosed as having either cortical (n=92) or lacunar (n=92) stroke. We used logistic regression to assess the relationship between stroke type and disc pallor in several zones and ordinal logistic regression to assess the relationship between disc pallor and total SVD score. The left and right eyes were analysed separately. In the right eye, independent of age, sex, disc area, hypertension and diabetes, increased optic disc pallor was significantly associated with lacunar stroke in all zones (for global pallor: OR per SD increase=1.55, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.17, p=0.011) and total SVD score in the temporal superior (standardised β=0.36, SE=0.15, p=0.020) and nasal-inferior zones (standardised β=0.44, SE=0.15, p=0.004) in the right eye. Weaker trends were observed in the left eye; however, these did not reach statistical significance. Optic disc pallor may be associated with SVD severity and lacunar stroke, which may reflect vascular damage to the optic nerve or its pathways. Our findings underscore the utility of colour fundus photography to learn more about SVD pathology.",

It raises the need to question what is being understood by intersectionality and how to understand the social determinants of women's health in research emanating from the field of health sciences. A brief historical framework on determinants is provided to illustrate the evolution of the analysis over time, along with the need to adopt an intersectional approach through Latin American theoretical reflection. The limitations and possibilities associated with combining these two approaches raise the urgency of interdisciplinary research with defined and contextualised epistemological frameworks. A final consideration is made on the synergy of approaches that can contribute to a deeper understanding of the social determinants of health.",

Low body mass index (BMI) was the common predisposing factor. Accurate preliminary diagnosis were made only in 8 patients with support of timely computed tomography (CT) scans. The rate of strangulated hernias was 33.33% (6/18)and intestinal resection was required in 4 cases. 11 patients underwent open surgery while 7 received laparoscopic surgery. Simple closure of the hernia defect or hight ligation was performed in 12, mesh repair in 6. No serious operative complications was observed. Obturator hernia should be included in the differential diagnosis of intestinal obstruction of unknown origin, especially in elderly women with low BMI. Early surgical intervention is imperative to avoid intestinal resection and reduce complications. Laparoscopy has a tendency to rapid recovery but has its limits.",

The present secondary analysis examined intravenous drug use (IDU) and psychosocial factors (partner status, employment status, educational attainment, number and custody of children) as correlates of six-month recidivism among women incarcerated in rural jails. Baseline and six-month follow-up data for 361 women were examined. Two logistic regression models tested IDU and psychosocial characteristics as correlates of six-month recidivism, highlighting changes in correlates from baseline (Model 1) to follow-up (Model 2). Model 1 indicated number of children and partner status as significant correlates. Model 2 indicated number of children, employment, and IDU as significant correlates.

Here we propose a machine learning-based method to predict the thermodynamic stability change resulting from tyrosine phosphorylation. Our approach, based on prediction of phosphomimetic delta-delta-G from structural features, strongly correlates with experimental mutational scanning cDNA proteolysis data (R = 0.71). We predicted the destabilizing effects of all 384,857 tyrosine residues from the Alphafold2 database. We then applied our approach to a pan-cancer phosphoproteomics dataset, comprising over 600 unique tyrosine phosphorylations across 11 cancer subtypes. We predict destabilizing phosphorylations in both oncogenes and tumor suppressors, where the former likely reflects a generalized relief of auto-inhibition or activating conformational change. We find that the number of circuit topological parallel relations with respect to residues contacting the phosphorylated site is greater for autoinhibited oncogenes than for other proteins (Wilcoxon p = 0.03). Utilizing an extreme gradient-boosting machine learning approach, we obtain an AUC of 0.85 for the prediction of autoinhibited phosphorylation states from circuit topological features. The top destabilized proteins from the pan-cancer data are enriched for chemical and oxidative stress pathways. Among metabolic proteins, highly destabilizing phosphorylations tend to occur in more peripheral proteins with lower network centrality measures (Wilcoxon p = 0.005). We predict 58% of recurrent tyrosine cancer phosphorylations to be destabilizing at the 1 kcal/mol threshold. Our approach can enable rapid screening of destabilizing phosphorylations and phosphomimetic mutations.",

This technique has been widely used and studied in the general population; however, research in pregnancy is limited. We aimed to evaluate obstetric and neonatal outcomes after low-dose buprenorphine induction. In this retrospective case series, we reviewed all cases of low-dose induction during pregnancy or within 6 weeks postpartum at an urban academic medical center over a 3-year period. Nine patients started buprenorphine using this method, and all but one completed induction. There was a high rate of treatment retention and no apparent associated adverse neonatal events. Four individuals are in sustained remission and currently parenting. Though further research is needed, low-dose buprenorphine induction appears effective in the obstetric population.",

Our results suggest that mothers bear part of the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility for men because a father's inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health cost of childbearing.",

    "title": "Integrating environmental effects in the benefit-risk assessment of therapeutic products: a proposal and example for sustainable health and healthcare.",
    "abstract": "To mitigate healthcare's unintended effects, environmental risk data such as ecotoxicity and environmental contamination need to be considered by all stakeholders in the healthcare value chain. As decision-makers and educators, healthcare providers are in a unique position to make healthcare delivery more sustainable. However, current benefit-risk assessments of therapeutic products do not systematically include environmental risk data. The purpose of this paper was to review the literature and regulatory context and propose expanding benefit-risk assessments of therapeutic products to include an evidence-based evaluation of environmental impact to inform decision-making. Our findings indicate that environmental risk assessments need to be broadened to include aspects such as excipients, synergistic effects of contaminants, and risks to humans (e.g., drinking water). Concrete proposals to improve current regulatory guidelines for environmental risk assessment already exist. Open access databases on environmental risk of substances used in products for human consumption are available. The European Union Regulation on Medical Devices provides the basis for evidence-based approach to developing sustainable therapeutic products based on natural substances. Based on this, the here promoted decision scheme for healthcare providers (and other stakeholders) involves comparing the clinical safety and efficacy of therapeutic products; comparing environmental impact data; and then deciding. A case example involving the treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux and dyspepsia is presented. We provide suggestions for integrating persistence and ecotoxicity data into clinical practice. Expanding the benefit-risk assessment to include data on environmental impact during clinical decision-making is a way to achieve a healthier outcome for all.",

We examine the broadest range of potential determinants of trustor sending to date, including risk tolerance, preferences for redistribution, and conformity. We find that even though self-interest, indicated by expected returns, is relevant for trustor behaviour, the most important correlate of sending is participants' altruism or fairness concerns, as measured by giving in a dictator game. We also find that in our large and representative sample, behaviour in the trust game and responses in a trust survey are significantly correlated, and that similar correlates-altruism in particular-are relevant for both.",

To test this, we combined cancer genomic analysis with extensive molecular dynamics simulations of mTOR oncogenic variants. We observed that conformational changes within mTOR kinase domain are associated with multiple mutational activation events. The mutations disturb the α-packing formed by the kαAL, kα3, kα9, kα9b, and kα10 helices in the kinase domain creating cryptic pocket. Its opening correlates with opening of the catalytic cleft, including active site residues realignment, favoring catalysis. The cryptic pocket created by disrupted α-packing coincides with the allosteric pocket in PI3Kα can be harmoniously fitted by the PI3Kα allosteric inhibitor RLY-2608, suggesting that analogous drugs designed based on RLY-2608 can restore the packed α-structure, resulting in mTOR inactive conformation.

    "abstract": "Superficial white matter (SWM) U-fibers contain considerable structural connectivity in the human brain; however, related studies are not well-developed compared to the well-studied deep white matter (DWM). Conventionally, SWM U-fiber is obtained through DWM tracking, which is inaccurate on the cortical surface. The significant variability in the cortical folding patterns of the human brain renders a conventional template-based atlas unsuitable for accurately mapping U-fibers within the thin layer of SWM beneath the cortical surface. Recently, new surface-based tracking methods have been developed to reconstruct more complete and reliable U-fibers. To leverage surface-based U-fiber tracking methods, we propose to create a surface-based U-fiber dictionary using high-resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We first identify the major U-fiber bundles and then build a dictionary containing subjects with high groupwise consistency of major U-fiber bundles. Finally, we propose a shape-informed U-fiber atlasing method for robust SWM connectivity analysis. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our shape-informed atlasing method can obtain anatomically more accurate U-fiber representations than state-of-the-art atlas. Additionally, our method is capable of restoring incomplete U-fibers in low-resolution dMRI, thus helping better characterize SWM connectivity in clinical studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).",

Spontaneous adrenal hemorrhage is a rare complication that complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with comorbidities. A 68-year-old male presented with severe abdominal pain, a history of hypertensive crises, and episodes of syncope. Imaging revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma originating from the right adrenal gland. Biochemical evaluation confirmed pheochromocytoma, and further imaging showed 75% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. A multidisciplinary team recommended right adrenalectomy prior to carotid intervention. After alpha-blockade with phenoxybenzamine, the patient underwent successful adrenalectomy and hematoma evacuation. Histopathology confirmed pheochromocytoma with hemorrhagic and degenerative features. Carotid artery stenting was performed postoperatively. Hemorrhagic pheochromocytoma may mimic other acute abdominal or vascular conditions, especially in patients on anticoagulation. Noradrenergic pheochromocytomas are linked to a higher risk of atherosclerosis. In such complex scenarios, surgical sequencing must be individualized. In patients with hemorrhagic pheochromocytoma and significant vascular disease, early tumor resection followed by vascular intervention can reduce perioperative risks. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for optimal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic dissemination is critically reliant on the formation of a receptive niche, a process which is thought to rely on signals derived from the primary tumor. Lymph nodes are continuously exposed to such signals through the flow of afferent lymph, allowing the potential reprograming of lymphoid tissue stroma in support of metastases or immunosuppression. The objective of this study was therefore to better characterize tumor-driven transcriptomic changes occurring to specific stromal populations within the tumor-draining lymph node. We utilize single cell RNA sequencing of dissociated LN tissue extracted from tumor-bearing and naïve mice to profile the reprograming of tissue stroma within the pre-metastatic lymph node. Resulting data provides transcriptomic evidence of tumor-induced imprinting on marginal reticular cells (MRCs) and floor lymphatic endothelial cells (fLECs) populating the subcapsular sinus. These alterations appear to be unique to the tumor-draining LN and are not observed during inflammatory antigenic challenge. Notably, MRCs exhibit characteristics reminiscent of early desmoplastic CAF differentiation, fLECs engage distinct chemoattractant pathways thought to facilitate recruitment of circulating cancer cells, and both stromal populations exhibit signs of metabolic reprograming and immune-modulating potential. Cumulatively, these findings build upon existing literature describing pre-metastatic niche formation and offer several promising avenues for future exploration.",

This is a cross-sectional study conducted in 7 nursing homes in the Manisa province, Turkiye. The data has been collected through face-to-face using a socio-demographic data form, the life satisfaction scale, and the suicide probability scale. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0, non-parametric statistical methods have been employed. The study included 278 elderly participants, 5 outliers were removed from the analysis. Among the included elderly participants (n=273), the anger score averages of males were higher. Low, high, and moderate income were found to have a higher suicide probability respectively. Those who resided in a nursing home for 3 years or more had higher anger scores. Elderly individuals residing in publicly funded nursing homes had higher averages in suicide probability, negative self, exhaustion, and anger scores. Further analyses were performed among the octogenarian population (n=149). Octogenarian males had higher scores in Suicide Probability, Disconnection from Life, and Anger Scale than the female octagenarian participants. Octogenarians with low income were found to experience a lack of attachment to life and higher levels of anger. In publicly funded nursing homes, octogenarians had higher suicide probability and anger scores compared to those in private nursing homes. The risk of suicide in octogenarians should be taken seriously. Factors such as gender, income level, and type of nursing home can influence this risk.",

This cross-sectional study included 50 treatment-naïve hypercholesterolemia patients and 50 age-matched healthy controls. None of the patients had other systemic diseases. CVI in the patient and control groups was compared. In addition, the effect of lipid levels on CVI was calculated. Analysis of covariance was used to compare groups after adjusting for axial length, age, and sex. The partial correlation coefficient was determined for the correlation between lipid levels and choroidal area in both groups. The level of statistical significance was set at <i>P</i> < 0.05. CVI was significantly lower in the study group (<0.001). There were no differences in total choroidal area (TCA) (<i>P</i> = 0.141) or luminal area (LA) (<i>P</i> = 0.539) between the groups. The stromal area (SA) was, however, significantly thicker in the patient group than in the control group (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Lipid levels and CVI were not correlated. The present findings show that hypercholesterolemia patients have a significantly thicker SA and a lower CVI than healthy controls. Interestingly, the increased stromal are in the patients did not result in an increase in the TCA or compressed vascular tissues that would have presented as a reduction in LA. The present findings should be considered preliminary, and additional studies with longer follow-ups may further clarify the effects of increased SA thickness.",

We propose a multi-pronged framework for researchers to mitigate these risks, looking first to existing ethical frameworks and regulatory measures researchers can adapt to their own work, next to off-the-shelf AI solutions, then to design-specific solutions researchers can build into their AI to mitigate misuse. When researchers remain unable to address the potential for harmful misuse, and the risks outweigh potential benefits, we recommend researchers consider a different approach to answering their research question, or a new research question if the risks remain too great. We apply this framework to three different domains of AI research where misuse is likely to be problematic: (1) AI for drug and chemical discovery; (2) generative models for synthetic data; (3) ambient intelligence.",

    "title": "The Prevalence and Determinants of Mental Health Problems in Lebanon: A Meta-Analytic Study of 3957 Healthcare Workers.",
    "abstract": "Healthcare workers are continuously exposed to challenging environments, making them liable for poor mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this problem, however available data in Lebanon is scarce. We conducted this investigation to provide comprehensive evidence on the mental health of Lebanese healthcare workers. In this systematic review, we analyzed 3957 workers reported in 15 cross-sectional studies (10 during and five before the pandemic), identified after searching four databases. Examined mental health problems included depression, anxiety, stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and poor sleep quality. STATA software was used to pool the prevalence across studies. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the pandemic status, severity of mental health problems, and healthcare worker type. Gender and marital status were analyzed as potential risk factors. The methodological quality of all included studies was good as per the National Institute of Health risk of bias tool. Anxiety, depression, stress, PTSD, insomnia, and poor sleep quality were reported in 50%, 52%, 50%, 35%, 45%, and 41% of the population, respectively. Most cases had mild anxiety (40%), mild depression (45%), but severe stress (27%). Depression and anxiety were highest among pharmacists (69% and 56%) and nurses (49% and 45%), respectively. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, depression (36% vs. 62%) and anxiety (30% vs. 56%) rates were higher during the pandemic, while stress levels were lower (62% vs. 45%). Both gender and marital status were insignificant predictors of depression, anxiety, stress, or PTSD. Depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, insomnia, and poor sleep quality are experienced by approximately one in every two Lebanese healthcare workers. The rate of depression and anxiety almost doubled during the pandemic with higher rates among pharmacists and nurses than physicians and residents. Both gender and marital status were deemed insignificant predictors of reported mental health problems.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents significant challenges in early diagnosis and intervention, impacting children and their families. With prevalence rates rising, there is a critical need for accessible and efficient screening tools. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques, in particular Temporal Action Localization (TAL), holds promise for automating ASD screening. This paper introduces a self-attention based TAL model designed to identify ASD-related behaviors in infant videos. Unlike existing methods, our approach simplifies complex modeling and emphasizes efficiency, which is essential for practical deployment in real-world scenarios. Importantly, this work underscores the importance of developing computer vision methods capable of operating in naturilistic environments with little equipment control, addressing key challenges in ASD screening. This study is the first to conduct end-to-end temporal action localization in untrimmed videos of infants with ASD, offering promising avenues for early intervention and support. We report baseline results of behavior detection using our TAL model. We achieve 70% accuracy for look face, 79% accuracy for look object, 72% for smile and 65% for vocalization.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosing Cushing Syndrome (CS) remains challenging due to its diverse symptoms and the complexity of its subtypes. This study aimed to optimize diagnostic cut-off values for differentiating CS subtypes using the 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in a cohort of 237 patients. Retrospective data from patients diagnosed with non-functional adrenal adenomas (NFA), mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS), adrenal CS, and pituitary CS at the Dokuz Eylül University Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinic (2005-2016) were analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity of morning cortisol levels after DST were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The analysis identified optimal morning cortisol cut-off levels: 2.14 μg/dL (59.04 nmol/L) for MACS, 2.3 μg/dL (63.4 nmol/L) for adrenal CS, and 2.33 μg/dL (64.28 nmol/L) for pituitary CS. These optimized thresholds demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, significantly improving diagnostic precision over the conventional threshold of 1.8 μg/dL (50 nmol/L). The findings underscore the importance of tailored cut-off values to address subtype-specific diagnostic challenges, reducing delays and mitigating long-term complications. Personalized diagnostic approaches, incorporating patient demographics and disease-specific characteristics, are essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and facilitating timely interventions.",

Findings are these diets correct metabolic parameters and intermittent calorie restriction diet regimen increases muscle strength. We investigated the effects on metabolic, anthropometric values and muscle in Intermittent Fasting (IF) and Continuous Calorie Restriction (CCR) groups in adult overweight and class 1 obese patients. The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: IF group (n=23), CCR group (n=21), and control group (n=22). Fat mass, and basal metabolic rate were recorded. Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI) was calculated. Handgrip strength was measured. Walking speed test was performed. The 'International Physical Activity Questionnaire' was administered to the patients. Weight, body mass index, fat mass, muscle mass, FFMI, waist circumference, right and left arm circumference, right and left calf circumference values decreased significantly and similarly compared to the beginning at the end of 6 months in the IF and CCR groups (p<0.05). A statistically significant increase was found in hand grip strength test measurements in the IF groups. IF and CCR diets enhance metabolic functions while reducing muscle mass. Despite this decrease, the IF diet increases muscular strength.",

Evaluation of the effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on osteopenia and osteoporosis concerning body mass is the aim of this study. A case-control study, including 400 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 200 healthy individuals, was designed. BMD T-score measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used as an indicator for osteopenia and osteoporosis, while body mass index (BMI) was used for determining obesity. The BMD value of osteoporosis was observed in most females of both groups, compared to males with osteopenia with no supported by statistical analysis. The BMI value indicated that obese individuals are more likely to develop osteopenia in both groups, although there were no significant differences. Subjects aged 40 and over showed high osteopenia, which is associated with obesity. There is no significant effect of gender, diabetes, or obesity on the BMD. Osteopenia is more prevalent in age groups over 40. The obese women remain at risk of osteoporosis and men are at risk of osteopenia.",

Here, we review whether and how insights from biological research have contributed to more effective treatments for aggression, with a focus on parenting interventions. We also outline specific strategies for researchers to integrate biological and clinical approaches to refine or augment parenting-focused interventions moving forward. In particular, we (1) evaluate the ability of biological data to provide unique and treatment-relevant insights into the mechanisms of aggression, beyond behavioral data; (2) outline ways of incorporating biological measures directly into clinical practice and possible drawbacks; and (3) discuss the privileged position of biological evidence in the eyes of policymakers and the public, including the potential to drive change at the risk of promoting biological essentialism. To meaningfully advance parenting interventions for childhood aggression, clinical scientists must be thoughtful about the promises and possible pitfalls of integrating biological and implementation-oriented approaches.",

    "abstract": "It is quite common to encounter compositional data in a regression framework in data analysis. When both responses and predictors are compositional, most existing models rely on a family of log-ratio based transformations to move the analysis from the simplex to the reals. This often makes the interpretation of the model more complex. A transformation-free regression model was recently developed, but it only allows for a single compositional predictor. However, many datasets include multiple compositional predictors of interest. Motivated by an application to hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) data, a novel extension of this transformation-free regression model is provided that allows for two (or more) compositional predictors to be used via a latent variable mixture. A modified expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed to estimate model parameters, which are shown to have natural interpretations. Conformal inference is used to obtain prediction limits on the compositional response. The resulting methodology is applied to the HTL dataset. Extensions to multiple predictors are discussed.",

Under this comprehensive framework, we introduce a novel MedGuard benchmark with 1,000 expert-verified questions. Our evaluation of 11 commonly used LLMs shows that the current language models, regardless of their safety alignment mechanisms, generally perform poorly on most of our benchmarks, particularly when compared to the high performance of human physicians.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to determine the prevalance of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in patients with Opioid Use Disorder and to investigate both the sociodemographic and psychological differences between patients with or without Hepatitis C Virus. Blood samples were taken from patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) who applied to Mersin Provincial Health Directorate Toros State Hospital Alcohol and Drug Addiction Treatment Center (AMATEM) between 01.09.2019-01.09.2020 and hepatitis virus markers, complete blood count and basic biochemistry were assessed. Sociodemographic Evaluation Form, Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Childhood Traumas Scale, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT), Temps-A Temperament Scale, Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale were applied to 107 patients with HCV and 101 patients without HCV who were selected by systematic sampling and the findings obtained were compared. Of the 1190 patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder, 340 (28.5%) were found to be HCV positive. 107 HCV-positive and 101 HCV- negative patients who were selected for comparison were similar in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. Among HCV positive patients, the rate of intravenous drug use and needle sharing were significantly higher (p<0.001, p<0.001). Overall duration of substance use and intravenous substance use were significantly higher in HCV positive patients (p=0.024 and p=0.017). Similarly, HCV positive group were significantly more likely (p<0.001) to have heard of HCV before and significantly more likely (p=0.009) to know that HCV causes cirrhosis and liver cancer. Regarding the scores of Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Childhood Traumas Scale, Substance Use Disorder Recognition Test, DUDIT, Temps -A Temperament Scales applied to HCV positive and HCV negative patients with Opioid Use Disorder, no difference was found. The scores of the 'Non-Acceptance' factor of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale were found to be significantly higher in HCV positive patients with Opioid Use Disorder (p=0.020). Patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) have higher rates of HCV positivity compared to general public. Intravenous drug use significantly increases this risk. Half of HCV-positive patients were unaware that they have the virus and only a very small proportion received treatment. Therefore, examining each patient with OUD for HCV, treating positive patients in an effective referral system seems to be the an important step in the eradication of this disease in this population.",

There were 4,153 firearm suicides during that period. Suicides often involved males, older adolescents (15-18y) and handguns. Most firearms belonged to the primary caregiver and incidents frequently occurred at home. However, we found that characteristics varied substantially across racial and ethnic groups. Overall, we provide new information on firearm suicides among adolescents in the US using a larger dataset than previous studies and found significant differences in characteristics and demographics across racial and ethnic groups.

    "title": "Seed Priming with Sulfur Oxidizing Bacteria Isolated from the Rhizosphere and their Effect on <i>Vigna radita</i> (L.).",
    "abstract": "The plant rhizosphere harbors various kinds of microbes that play significant roles in plant growth. Sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB) play a vital role in the oxidation of elemental sulfur to plant accessible sulfate, which helps in plant growth, acts as a biocontrol, and acts as a bioleaching agent. In our present work, we explored the diversity of sulfur oxidizing bacteria from the rhizosphere of <i>Catharanthus</i>, <i>Begonia</i>, <i>Pisum</i>, <i>Trigonella</i>, <i>Spinacia</i> and <i>Azadirachta</i>. Twenty five bacterial strains were isolated and stabbed in thiosulfate containing growth medium. Out of twenty five isolates, six most effective strains, CR1, PS2, SO3, TF4, BS5 and AI6 with a remarkable change in color of the thiosulfate containing growth medium from red to yellow due to sulfate production, were selected for plant growth promoting activities such as phosphate solubilization, IAA production, HCN and ammonia production. All six bacterial strains showed significant Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobial (PGPR) activities with the production of indole-3-acetic acid (662 to 724 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>) and phosphate solubilization (7 to 14 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>). Selected strains and their consortium are further assessed for growth responses on <i>Vigna radiata</i> L. under in-vitro conditions. Based on the analysis of variances, seed priming with different sulfur oxidizing bacterial strains showed a significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05) effect on vigor index. The vigor index increased in primed as compared to unprimed seeds of <i>Vigna radiata</i> L. The maximum growth rate of seedlings for the single culture of CR1 (10.80) and for the mixed culture of CR1 + BS5 (10.94) was observed as compared to the control. All six SOB strains showed in-vitro plant growth promoting activities and may be used as a viable alternative to organic fertilizers and as potential applicants for sustainable agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Perovskites are of high potential in the ongoing academic research, due to their distinctive electrical properties and crystalline structures. Halide perovskites show high light emissive properties and panchromatic light absorption across the visible spectrum. The exceptional electrical characteristics, such as their long carrier lifespan, high diffusion length, and charge carrier mobility, allow the electric charges to be transported and collected effectively. Furthermore, by tuning the cations and anions composition, perovskite's opto-electrical properties can be altered. Moreover, dimension reduction affects their band gap and intrinsic features to induce higher structural stability but at the cost of the quantum confinement effect. Owing to their exceptional properties, halide perovskites are being researched in energy-related and semiconducting applications, hold high promise and the future looks bright. But challenges remain, and the larger question is what needs to be done to make them more stable.",

    "abstract": "Perceivers recognize pain less readily on Black (vs. White) faces in the United States. The present work investigated whether this perceptual bias is moderated by target weight and gender across three experiments. Anti-Black bias in pain perception was mitigated within heavier-weight (vs. average-weight) male-appearing targets (Experiment 1) but was independent of female-appearing targets' weight (Experiment 2). A well-powered, pre-registered Experiment 3 replicated these findings, confirming that target weight and gender interactively shaped anti-Black bias in pain perception: target weight moderated perceptual bias within male-appearing (but not female-appearing) faces. These findings help illuminate factors that interact to shape racial bias in pain perception and demonstrate the importance of intersectionality when studying social perceptual biases.",

    "abstract": "We examine some of the opportunities and challenges concerned with establishing a centralized national kidney exchange program in Germany. Despite the many advantages of a national program, without deliberate design and policy intervention, a fragmented kidney exchange program may emerge. We study a number of collaboration strategies, and resulting simulations suggest that transplant centers may find it advantageous not to fully participate, resulting in a net reduction in the number of transplants. These results also suggest that allowing more forms of kidney exchange, such as three-way exchanges and non-directed donations, can significantly increase the number of transplants while making participation in a national program more attractive and thus national coordination and cooperation more robust. We propose a multi-level policy approach that is easy to implement and would promote an efficient German kidney exchange program that benefits recipients, donors and hospitals.",

    "title": "Association of Resolved Low-Lying Placentation With Risk of Postpartum Hemorrhage.",
    "abstract": "To evaluate whether individuals who have a placenta previa or low-lying placenta that resolves before delivery are at increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and postpartum hemorrhage-related morbidity. This was a prospective, multicenter, 1:3 matched cohort study of pregnant individuals with singleton gestations diagnosed with low placentation by transvaginal scan at 19 to 23 weeks of gestation between January 2021 and December 2023 at nine academic maternity centers (exposed participants). Unexposed participants were those with a normally located placenta, matched in a 1:3 ratio according to parity. Resolution of low placentation was diagnosed when placenta was at 20 mm or more from the internal os. Individuals with fetal anomalies, hematologic disorders, therapeutic anticoagulation, placenta accreta spectrum disorder, vasa previa, persistent low placentation at birth, and delivery at a nonenrolling center were excluded. Primary outcome was postpartum hemorrhage of 1,000 mL or more. Secondary outcomes included postpartum hemorrhage of 1,500 mL or more, use of second-line uterotonic drugs, blood transfusions, additional procedures to control bleeding, intensive care unit admission, and hospital stay for more than 7 days. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for confounders was used to estimate independent associations with outcomes. The study population included 182 exposed and 589 unexposed participants. Individuals with resolved low placentation had higher rates of smoking (<i>P</i>=.024), prior dilation and curettage (<i>P</i>=.012), posterior placenta (<i>P</i><.001), and induction of labor (<i>P</i>=.038). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounders showed that exposed people had higher odds of postpartum hemorrhage of 1,000 mL or more (13.2% vs 4.1%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.1) compared with unexposed people and of use of second-line uterotonic drugs (28.0% vs 12.4%, aOR 2.69) and tranexamic acid (16.5% vs 7.5%, aOR 2.19), as well as hospital stay longer than 7 days (11.5% vs 3.4%, aOR 2.63). Individuals with resolved low placentation are at increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and related complications compared with those who always had a normally located placenta.",

    "abstract": "Anesthesia for interventional bronchoscopy (IB) presents significant challenges, primarily due to unpredictable responses such as coughing, airway spasms, and desaturation, even with monitored anesthetic care. However, the nociception inducing such responses and the impact of adding topical anesthesia (TA) have rarely been investigated. This study aims to map the timing and intensity of nociception, determine TA onset, and clarify TA's role in blocking nociception with subsequent IB procedures. Analgesia nociception index (ANI) and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) were collected in patients undergoing IB procedures with bispectral index (BIS)-controlled intravenous anesthesia. Data were compared and analyzed along with various stages: anesthetic induction with iGel insertion, fibro-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) insertion, and applying TA with the spray-as-you-go (SAYGO) method using xylocaine, up to 30 minutes with subsequent IB procedures. Data from 82 patients were analyzed. Under BIS-controlled anesthesia, iGel insertion decreased ANI significantly (P < 0.001). Following stabilization, ANI decreased significantly with SAYGO (P < 0.001), returned toward baseline within 5 minutes, and remained stably higher than baseline for up to 30 minutes. The changes on MBP were similar to those of ANI. No significant correlations were observed between BIS levels and ANI. ANI offers a valuable perspective on nociception, serves as a helpful reference for precise anesthetic management for IB. The key action, such as an ultrashort-acting anesthetic just before FOB insertion to block nociception from the establishment of TA without prolonged effect, is suggested for smooth, subsequent IB procedures.",

    "title": "Band-selective IR PRESS for brain tumor spectroscopy allows robust detection of lactate.",
    "abstract": "Lactate plays a critical role in the tumor microenvironment, driving tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Despite its importance, in vivo quantification of lactate using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has faced challenges, primarily due to the overlapping lipid signal at 1.3 ppm. Current clinical practice employs a long echo time to exploit differences in T2 relaxation between lactate and lipids; however, this approach significantly suppresses signals from other metabolites. Lipid has a notably different T1 relaxation time than lactate and other metabolites, which may be exploited by an inversion recovery sequence to better distinguish them. However, this method has not found wide use because of the loss of signal in other metabolites. Here we introduce a selective inversion pulse with a short echo time MRS method (SPIR-PRESS), which mitigates this issue. In phantom experiments, SPIR-PRESS successfully suppressed lipid signals that could be misinterpreted as lactate in short TE PRESS spectra, while maintaining sensitivity to the full metabolite profile. SPIR-PRESS demonstrated superior performance in quantifying lactate compared to long echo time PRESS, with ~ 60 % increase in sensitivity for lactate detection compared to conventional PRESS with a 288 ms TE. In a mouse glioma model, SPIR-PRESS clearly detected lactate and other key tumor metabolites (choline, creatine, NAA) in the tumor, which were not detectable in conventional long TE PRESS. These findings highlight SPIR-PRESS as a promising technique for improved lactate quantification and comprehensive metabolite profiling in tumor environments.",

    "abstract": "To analyze trends in severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and route-specific complications of birth in Illinois hospitals from January 2016 to June 2023. This retrospective population-based cohort study analyzed birth admission data from 159 hospitals using the Illinois Hospital Association Comparative Health Care and Hospital Data Reporting Services database from January 2016 to June 2023. Primary outcomes were incidence of SMM and route-specific delivery complications. Secondary outcomes included incidence of chronic and pregnancy-related comorbidities. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios for SMM; logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for route-specific birth complications; and model SEs were adjusted for clustering of observations within hospitals. In this cohort of 988,480 births, the overall SMM rate was 1.6%; the rate of SMM rose from 1.4% in 2016 to 2.0% in 2023. The rate of SMM was 0.9% for people who underwent vaginal births and 3.2% for people who underwent for cesarean births. Vaginal birth complications (7.3% overall) increased 22.4%, and cesarean birth complications (10.9% overall) increased 48.9%. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and anemia, both of which increased over the study period, were significant risk factors for SMM and birth complications. Over the study period, there were also increases in International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision-coded gestational diabetes (4.2-5.5%), depression (2.5-6.6%), anxiety (3.1-10.4%), and other chronic comorbidities (4.7-7.4%). Non-Hispanic Black patients had more than double the SMM rate (2.6%) compared with non-Hispanic White patients (1.1%). From 2016 to 2023, the rates of SMM and birth complications in Illinois increased alongside increases in coding for chronic and prepregnancy and pregnancy-related comorbidities. This study demonstrates the burden of cesarean birth-associated adverse outcomes, including a higher rate of SMM, which increased over the study period.",

    "abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with a history of early-life adversity (ELA), an association that is particularly strong in women. In a rodent model, we previously found that ELA enhances risk for opioid addiction selectively in females, but the mechanisms for this effect are unclear. Here, we show that ELA robustly alters cFos responses to opioid drugs in females' nucleus accumbens (NAc) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), but not else-where. We further identify delta opioid receptors (DOR), which mature in the first week of life and thus later than kappa or mu opioid receptors, as a potential mediator of ELA's impacts on reward circuit functions. Accordingly, DOR mRNA in NAc was persistently reduced in adult females with ELA history. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of NAc DORs increased opioid demand in control females (recapitulating the ELA phenotype), while blocking DORs in ELA females conversely reduced high-effort drug consumption, simulating the control rearing phenotype. These findings support a role for NAc DORs in mediating ELA-induced opioid vulnerability. In contrast, BLA neurons expressing DOR protein do not overlap heroin- responsive cells in ELA rats, arguing against a direct relationship of BLA DORs to heroin's addiction-relevant actions in the brain. Together, these results suggest a novel and selective role for NAc DORs in contributing to enduring, ELA-provoked vulnerability to OUD.",

    "abstract": "Algeria has made significant progress in addressing childhood undernutrition. Despite improvements, nearly 12% of Algerian children under five years of age suffered from stunting in 2022. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of three indicators of undernutrition (stunting, wasting, and underweight) and their associated variables in children aged 0-23 months in Algeria between 2013 and 2019. Pooled data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) (2012-13 and 2018-19) covering 14,498 children were used. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to test the associations. Stunting decreased significantly, but wasting and being underweight showed no significant reductions from 2013 to 2019. Stunting, wasting, and underweight decreased by 2.2%, 1.3%, and 0.3%, respectively, with an overall prevalence of 10.1%, 5.4%, and 3.6%, respectively. Factors associated with undernutrition included child age and small size at birth, whereas stunting was linked to the poorest households, male children, higher maternal body mass index (BMI), and low antenatal care (ANC) visits. Wasting was associated with younger age and paternal age, fewer maternal ANC visits, underweight male sex, low maternal education, high maternal BMI, and delayed breastfeeding initiation. Public health experts and stakeholders must adopt a comprehensive community-centered approach to achieve long-term improvements in child nutrition in Algeria. This strategy should focus on key factors including high maternal BMI, low maternal education, male children, and infrequent ANC visits. This action can help Algeria progress towards achieving the UN's goal of eradicating malnutrition.",

    "abstract": "Generalized arterial calcification of infancy is a rare genetic disorder that was first reported in 1899. Since then, slightly more than 200 cases have been documented. This rare autosomal recessive disorder occurs when the homozygous <i>ENPP1</i> gene mutation is associated with abnormal calcification in the medium and large arteries in the fetus. Overall mortality in individuals with generalized arterial calcification of infancy is high (55%) before the age of 6 months, with 24.4% dying in utero. Due to the high mortality rate, there is a critical need for additional reports and research regarding generalized arterial calcification of infancy. We submit a case report of a child with generalized arterial calcification of infancy-a unique instance in which the diagnosis was established prenatally and treatment was initiated in utero. Patient care was continued through a multidisciplinary approach coordinated between specialists across India, Australia, and the United States. There was an almost complete resolution of the calcification, with near-normal development and intellectual capacity of the child for age. Clear guidelines are needed regarding prenatal use of bisphosphonate therapy, timing, dosage, and duration of treatment for fetuses with <i>ENPP1</i> gene mutations to minimize disease progression and improve neonatal health at birth. This case further illustrates how involving well-informed parents in decision making can help tailor the appropriate treatment. Our report also describes the possibility of new, ongoing clinical trials that may pave the way for a cure for this child and others.",

    "abstract": "Biodegradation of toxic cyanobacterial cyclic peptides microcystins (MCs) by heterotrophic bacteria isolated from freshwater has gained global interest as an eco-friendly approach for water treatment. This study focused on elucidating the structures of MC-LR breakdown products generated by a group of five bacteria previously isolated from Lake Erie. Three isomers of a tetrapeptide NH<sub>2</sub>-Adda-Glu-Mdha-Ala-OH (Adda-TetraP-1, 2, and 3) and a cyclic tripeptide NH<sub>2</sub>-Adda-Glu-Mdha-OH (Adda-TriP) were identified during the MC-LR degradation process. Of these peptides, only linear Adda-TetraP-1 was described previously. UHPLC-high-resolution (HR)-MS and MS/MS data acquired for tetrapeptides and the tripeptide and their thiol derivatization showed that Adda-TetraP-2, Adda-TetraP-3, and Adda-TriP were cyclic peptides that contained modified Mdha and Adda moieties. The experimental evidence suggests that the Adda amine group of Adda-TetraP-1 underwent intramolecular aza-Michael reaction with the Mdha double bond to form a cyclic tetrapeptide, which appeared in two diastereomeric forms, of which Adda-TetraP-2 was formed faster than Adda-Tetra-P-3. The Mdha-Ala peptide bond of Adda-TetraP-2 appeared to be hydrolyzed by bacteria to form Adda-TriP. Independent of our laboratory cultures, Adda-TetraP-1, 2, and 3 were detected in Lake Erie water during cyanobacterial blooms, and identifying them will assist in elucidating biodegradation pathways of MC congeners and genes relevant to MC degradation.",

    "title": "Environment Scan of Generative AI Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Science.",
    "abstract": "This study reports a comprehensive environmental scan of the generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure in the national network for clinical and translational science across 36 institutions supported by the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program led by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the United States. With the rapid advancement of GenAI technologies, including large language models (LLMs), healthcare institutions face unprecedented opportunities and challenges. This research explores the current status of GenAI integration, focusing on stakeholder roles, governance structures, and ethical considerations by administering a survey among leaders of health institutions (i.e., representing academic medical centers and health systems) to assess the institutional readiness and approach towards GenAI adoption. Key findings indicate a diverse range of institutional strategies, with most organizations in the experimental phase of GenAI deployment. The study highlights significant variations in governance models, with a strong preference for centralized decision-making but notable gaps in workforce training and ethical oversight. Moreover, the results underscore the need for a more coordinated approach to GenAI governance, emphasizing collaboration among senior leaders, clinicians, information technology staff, and researchers. Our analysis also reveals concerns regarding GenAI bias, data security, and stakeholder trust, which must be addressed to ensure the ethical and effective implementation of GenAI technologies. This study offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of GenAI integration in healthcare, providing a roadmap for institutions aiming to leverage GenAI for improved quality of care and operational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "First trimester placental development comprises some of the most critical yet understudied events that impact fetal development. Improper placentation leads to a host of health issues that not only impact the fetal period but also influence offspring throughout their lives. Thus, a paradigm to study early placental development is necessary, and this has spurred on the pursuit of new in vitro model systems that recapitulate specific aspects of placentation. One of the most complex and translationally valid models to arise are organoids, three-dimensional structures comprising multiple differentiated cell types that originate from a common progenitor population. Trophoblasts are the progenitor cells of the placenta, serving as the proliferative base for placental development. Recent advances have enabled the derivation of organoids from primary tissue, yet access to first trimester human samples is ethically constrained; derivation from established trophoblast stem cell lines is an alternative source. Organoids have already proven useful in generating insights into molecular events that underlie trophoblast differentiation, with the identification of new cell subtypes that are primed to differentiate down different paths. In this review, (1) we recap early pregnancy development events, (2) provide an overview of the cellular complexity of the placenta, (3) discuss the generation of organoids from tissue versus cellular sources, (4) highlight the value of translational animal models, and (5) focus on the complexities of the molecular regulation of trophoblast organoid development, differentiation, and function.",

However, the adverse effects of increased oxidative stress have the potential to damage not only cancer cells, but also normal cells, potentially leading to ocular diseases such as pterygium and cataract. A 9-year-old patient presented with bilateral nasal pterygia and early bilateral cortical cataracts, which are uncommon for his age group. The patient has a background of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) V600E-positive pilocytic astrocytoma with anaplastic features, diagnosed at age 2.5 years old.

    "title": "Distributing <i>Zakatu Kasbil 'Amal</i> as an Alternative to Student Funding, Evidence in Indonesia's Universities.",
    "abstract": "Rising tuition costs and unequal access to higher education have prompted Indonesian universities to explore Zakat-based funding models to support needy students. In contrast, the use of Zakat on income ( <i>Zakatu kasbil 'amal</i>) and the <i>Fisabilillah</i> category for scholarships has been increasingly practiced; their implementation remains shaped by theological debates and institutional innovations. This study examines how universities integrate fatwa-driven legitimacy with Zakat governance to mobilize Zakat and expand student support systems. This study combines a systematic literature review with an exploratory qualitative approach. Academic publications, Scopus-indexed articles, national regulations, institutional reports, and relevant fatwas were analyzed to examine how theological perspectives and institutional practices interact in mobilizing Zakat for student funding. Evidence from university cases contextualized findings, such as PUSPAS UNAIR, UPZ UIN Sumatera Utara, BAZNAS, and LAZISMU. The findings reveal two applied contributions. First, Zakat on income has been institutionalized by universities through various mechanisms, including establishing <i>Unit Pengumpul Zakat</i> (UPZ), forming private Zakat Institutions or collaborating with BAZNAS and LAZISMU. Supported by Indonesian Ulema Council Fatwa No. 3/2003, these institutional models embed auto-debit payroll systems and structured governance processes, transforming Zakat on income into a sustainable funding source for student scholarships. Second, universities expand the use of the <i>Fisabilillah</i> category as a legitimate <i>asnaf</i> for distributing Zakat-based scholarships. While classical scholars traditionally limit <i>Fisabilillah</i> to battle-related jihad, contemporary fatwas, including Indonesian Ulema Council Fatwa No. 120/1996, Dar al-Ifta Egypt (2007), and Jordan's Fatwa No. 2847 (2013), permit allocating Zakat to education when it serves the collective benefit. Universities operationalize this broader fiqh application through structured programs such as the BAZNAS Scholarship Institute, LAZISMU's scholarship schemes, and university-managed funding initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Universal access to maternal, newborn, and child healthcare is essential for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, but the effectiveness of various incentive-based programs for pregnant mothers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains uncertain. Objective of this systematic review was to determine if incentive-based interventions influenced maternal and neonatal health outcomes. We conducted a search in various databases from inception. All incentive-based interventional studies conducted on pregnant women in LMICs were included. Evidence from the included trials was synthesized using risk ratios (RRs) to compare the outcomes between groups receiving incentives and not receiving incentives. The meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and reviewed the collected data to determine its suitability for meta-analysis. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021247681). Of the 3,897 records that were identified, 11 met eligibility criteria, all of which exhibited varying degrees of risk of bias, ranging from high to some concerns. Analysis of maternal outcomes across studies revealed no significant differences in the likelihood of delivering at a healthcare facility (RR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.47) and in frequency of prenatal care (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.12) between intervention and control groups. However, high levels of statistical heterogeneity were observed for both outcomes indicating variability among study results. Similarly, analysis of tetanus vaccine coverage showed no significant difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.08), with moderate statistical heterogeneity observed. The maternal and neonatal outcomes examined in this review did not have any significant differences in intervention group when compared to the control group. The interventions to address maternal health concerns need to follow a multifactorial approach. There is a need for extensive primary research studies in the future.",

    "abstract": "The integration of neural representations in the two hemispheres is an important problem in neuroscience. Recent experiments revealed that odor responses in cortical neurons driven by separate stimulation of the two nostrils are highly correlated. This bilateral alignment points to structured inter-hemispheric connections, but detailed mechanism remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that continuous exposure to environmental odors shapes these projections and modeled it as online learning with local Hebbian rule. We found that Hebbian learning with sparse connections achieves bilateral alignment, exhibiting a linear trade-off between speed and accuracy. We identified an inverse scaling relationship between the number of cortical neurons and the inter-hemispheric projection density required for desired alignment accuracy, i.e., more cortical neurons allow sparser inter-hemispheric projections. We next compared the alignment performance of local Hebbian rule and the global stochastic-gradient-descent (SGD) learning for artificial neural networks. We found that although SGD leads to the same alignment accuracy with modestly sparser connectivity, the same inverse scaling relation holds. We showed that their similar performance originates from the fact that the update vectors of the two learning rules align significantly throughout the learning process. This insight may inspire efficient sparse local learning algorithms for more complex problems.",

We consider data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey from 10 states that asked about unaccompanied homelessness and sleeping arrangement. Students who experienced any form of homelessness were at higher risk for poor outcomes and other risk experiences. Few students reported both unaccompanied homelessness and usually sleeping in a homeless situation. Youth experiencing unaccompanied homelessness had higher risk for alcohol problems and lower risk for severe drug use and poor grades compared to students who experienced other forms of homelessness; otherwise they had similar levels of risk for poor outcomes. Results are consistent with the view that students who experience unaccompanied homeless are a distinguishable subpopulation of students who experience homelessness and are at high levels of risk of poor outcomes.",

Similarly, the TTEF is instrumental for specifying key design components of a hypothetical randomized trial and identifying which of these an EC study can and cannot emulate. We offer considerations about the joint application of both frameworks by combining the five EF attributes- <i>treatment, population, endpoint, intercurrent events,</i> and <i>population-level summary</i>-with the seven TTEF components- <i>eligibility criteria</i>, <i>treatment strategies</i>, <i>assignment procedures</i>, <i>follow-up period</i>, <i>outcomes</i>, <i>causal contrasts</i>, and <i>data analysis plan.</i> Any overlap is identified, as well as omissions and unique contributions from both frameworks.

    "abstract": "The CD225/Dispanins superfamily consists of membrane proteins that regulate vesicular transport and membrane fusion events driving neurotransmission, glucose transport, and antiviral immunity. However, how the CD225 domain controls membrane trafficking was unknown. We reveal that the CD225 domain contains a SNARE-like motif that enables interaction with cellular SNARE fusogens. Proline rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) encodes a SNARE-like motif that enables interaction with neuronal SNARE proteins, and mutations therein disrupt SNARE binding and are linked to neurological disease. Another CD225 member, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), protects cells against Influenza A virus infection. IFITM3 interacts with SNARE proteins that mediate late endosome-late endosome (homotypic) fusion and late endosome-lysosome (heterotypic) fusion. IFITM3 binds to syntaxin 7 (STX7) in cells and in vitro, and mutations that abrogate STX7 binding cause loss of antiviral activity against Influenza A virus. Mechanistically, IFITM3 disrupts assembly of the SNARE complex controlling homotypic fusion and accelerates the trafficking of endosomal cargo to lysosomes. Our results suggest that SNARE modulation plays a previously unrecognized role in the diverse functions performed by CD225 proteins.",

This tumor primarily afflicts adolescents and young adults, with slight male bias, often near large joints like the knee and hip. Intra-articular synovial sarcoma, an even rarer subset, can delay diagnosis due to its slow growth and vague clinical signs. We present a unique case of primary knee intra-articular synovial sarcoma in a 24-year-old female. Imaging revealed a distinct lesion adjacent to the medial femoral condyle and patellofemoral joint, initially suggestive of synovial haemangioma. However, histopathology confirmed biphasic synovial sarcoma, characterized by spindle and gland-like epithelial components. Immunohistochemistry further supported the diagnosis. Reviewing documented cases, we find that synovial sarcoma can affect a wide age range but often occurs in the knee joint, emphasizing the need for vigilance.

Our review focuses on the recent advancements in statistical inference for causal mediation analysis, especially in the context of high-dimensional mediation analysis. We delve into the complexities of testing mediation effects, especially addressing the challenge of testing a large number of composite null hypotheses. Through extensive simulation studies, we compare the existing methods across a range of scenarios. We also include an analysis of data from the Normative Aging Study, which examines DNA methylation CpG sites as potential mediators of the effect of smoking status on lung function.

    "title": "Distribution-agnostic Probabilistic Few-shot Learning for Multimodal Recognition and Prediction.",
    "abstract": "In industrial scenarios with insufficient sensor data, intelligent few-shot failure mode recognition and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction are critically essential for effective prognostics and health management. Existing few-shot learning (FSL) methods focus on either the failure mode recognition as a classification problem or the RUL prediction as a regression problem, failing to capture the dependence between failure modes and RUL given that units under different failure modes present distinct degradation characteristics. To address the issue, this paper proposes a distribution-agnostic probabilistic FSL method for multimodal recognition and prediction of operating units. The proposed model establishes a neural network with prototypes to solve a few-shot classification- and regression-integrated problem. To fully capture the uncertainty caused by limited sensor data, we develop multimodal Bayesian model-agnostic meta-learning (MBMAML) for the probabilistic modeling of failure modes and the RUL under multiple failure modes. We construct the loss function based on probabilistic modeling that captures the interaction between failure modes and RUL for model training. Finally, the proposed model adaptively learns the approximate distributions of failure modes and RUL for a new operating unit. We evaluate the proposed model performance through a case study on the degradation of aircraft gas turbine engines. Failure mode recognition and RUL prediction are essential in prognostics health management (PHM) to avoid unexpected failures of units in industrial systems, such as aircraft gas turbine engines. However, insufficient sensor data are quite common issue in industrial scenarios due to expensive sensor deployment, the difficulty of installing sensors to certain special mechanical equipment, and so on. This paper aims to develop a FSL method that jointly recognize the failure mode and predict the RUL of a unit based on insufficient sensor data. The four steps to implement the proposed method in practice are as follows: <i>First</i>, collect sensor signal data, RUL data, and failure mode data of units. <i>Second</i>, construct the model framework via the proposed MBMAML. <i>Third</i>, formulate the loss function based on the probability distributions of failure modes and RUL, and train the model using collected data. <i>Fourth</i>, adaptively recognize the failure mode and predict the RUL of a new operating unit. The proposed method is expected to be applicable to many practical few-shot industrial scenarios due to its data-driven neural network with flexible model structure.",

    "title": "Myths Regarding Gender Differences in Eating Disorders in Adolescents.",
    "abstract": "Factors predicting eating disorder (ED) may vary among genders. This study investigated the gender specific influence of adolescents' social media use, body perception, depression and anxiety symptoms on eating disorder risk. The sample consisted of 183 adolescents aged 14 to 18 years (mean: 115.65±0.89). Sociodemographic information and data from the, Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Social Media Attitude Scale (SMAS), Eating Disorder Examination Scale (EDES), Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders Child Version (SCARED), and Body Cathexis Scale (BCS) were collected. In this study, women have higher scores in SCARED (p<0.001), and lower scores in social competence subscale of SMAS (p=0.008) in comparison to men. Adolescents at risk for eating attitudes had higher scores in the CDI, the BCS, and the SMAS-Social Competence subscale, while adolescents at risk for eating disorder had higher scores in all scales except the SMAS-Relationship with Teachers subscale. Although depression and body perception influence women's' eating attitudes directly, social media revealed its effect on ED by the mediation of depressive symptoms. In men, social isolation, anxiety, and depression directly predicts ED, while social media enhanced the risk of ED by aggravating anxiety. It is important to know the factors that influence the risk of ED in terms of gender, and effectively address adolescence's psychological and medical burden.",

    "title": "British Skull Base Society Consensus on Vestibular Schwannoma Surveillance.",
    "abstract": "Surveillance plays a crucial role in managing patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs). Consensus is lacking on the optimal duration, frequency, and modality of imaging. Standardizing this approach would ensure safe and effective care, reduce patient distress, and promote consistency in management decisions among clinicians. In July 2022, a multi-disciplinary Delphi consensus was conducted at the British Skull Base Society Meeting. Expert United Kingdom-based skull-base surgeons and neuroradiologists were presented semi-systematic literature reviews summarizing current evidence on VS management. Anonymized opinions were collated and discussed to reach a majority vote, which was deemed the final consensus opinion. Recommendations for VS managed by surveillance are: (1) surveillance frequency should decrease over time; (2) surveillance may be discontinued when the remaining lifetime risk of VS growth is <0.5% (∼8.5 years); (3) factors such as age, VS size, VS location, and cystic components should be considered. Surveillance after surgery or radiotherapy has limited evidence but recommendations are: (4) surveillance should be adjusted based on residual tumor size or nodular enhancement. Imaging modality and sequences are recommended to be (5) high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging with T1, T2, FIESTA/CISS multiplanar sequences, contrast is not required in untreated cases, and linear reporting of measurements is pragmatically sufficient. This consensus and literature review provides an evidence and expert opinion-based guide to help clinicians with the surveillance of patients with VS. Further research should focus on better understanding the dynamic nature of growth risks and the growth characteristics of postintervention VS to enable personalized growth risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "Persistent inequities in the educational success of Black adolescents are a critical social justice concern. Though psychological distress has been associated with worse educational outcomes, less is known about the mechanisms that may influence this association. This study used nationally representative cross-sectional data from the National Survey of American Life-Adolescent (NSAL-A; 2001-2004) to explore how developmental assets (i.e., self-esteem, mastery, school bonding, educational aspirations, educational expectations) mediate associations between psychological distress (i.e., perceived stress, depressive symptoms) and educational outcomes (i.e., grades, grade repetition, suspensions, expulsions) among 1,170 Black adolescents ages 13-17 (52% female; mean age 15). The study found that educational expectations was a statistically significant mediator; lower psychological distress was associated with greater expectations which, in turn, was linked to better grades, lower grade repetition, and fewer expulsions. Additionally, school bonding was a statistically significant mediator such that lower perceived stress and depressive symptoms were associated with better school bonding. In turn, school bonding was associated with higher grades and fewer school expulsions. Self-esteem also significantly mediated the association between psychological distress and grade repetition. Study findings can contribute to precision in identifying culturally relevant targets of interventions among Black adolescents and help to address racial disparities in adolescent educational outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Georgia is a middle-income country with high male smoking rates and recently implemented public smoke-free policies. In contexts like Georgia, smoke-free homes (SFHs) can play crucial roles in reducing secondhand smoke exposure and use prevalence. This study examined barriers and facilitators to SFHs among Georgian adults. In February-March 2024, focus groups were conducted separately with smoking and nonsmoking adults in 2 rural communities (n=25; Mage=42.92, 52.0% female, 48.0% married). Data were examined using thematic analysis. Smoking participants (n=13) were primarily (84.6%) male; nonsmoking participants (n=12) were primarily (91.7%) female. Despite 72.2% reporting complete SFH restrictions, several exceptions and implementation challenges were noted. Smoking was commonly allowed for certain people (e.g., guests) or rooms/spaces (e.g., kitchen, balcony). Salient challenges included prevalent male smoking, difficulty changing behavior (smoking in general and smoking in the home), noncompliance, and accommodating guests, older extended family members, and important traditions and celebrations. However, important SFH motives were the health of non-smokers, particularly children, and serving as good role models for children. Effective SFH interventions for Georgian households must address specific characteristics (e.g., high male smoking rates, hospitality, accommodating important traditions) and may serve as models for other countries with similar characteristics.",

Perioperative measures to reduce the likelihood of such complications have not been evaluated, and this study sought to compare outcomes before and after implementation of an institutional perioperative protocol in the management of SBECs. Review of a prospective database of surgically managed SBECs. Outcomes were compared before (2003-2008) and after (2010-2021) implementation of a perioperative protocol including intraoperative hyper-irrigation, prolonged course of postoperative steroids, and aggressive management of CSF malabsorption. A total of 39 patients were included: 12 before and 27 after implementation of the protocol. The groups were similar with respect to mean age ( <i>p</i>  = 0.99), gender ( <i>p</i>  = 0.29), surgical approach-most commonly retrosigmoid ( <i>p</i>  > 0.99)-and extent of resection-most commonly total or near total ( <i>p</i>  = 0.64). The post-protocol implementation group had a significantly lower rate of CSF diversion ( <i>p</i>  = 0.04). The overall rates of hydrocephalus (7 vs. 30%), CSF leak (19 vs. 33%), bacterial meningitis (15 vs. 33%), and mean length of stay (12 vs. 49 days) were lower in the post-implementation group, although differences did not reach statistical significance. Rates of aseptic meningitis and cranial nerve palsies were similar. Our additional perioperative measures resulted in more favorable CSF dynamics with reduced need for CSF diversion and secondary consequences such as wound leaks and infective meningitis.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we explored the associations between endorsing two stereotypes of people with social anxiety disorder (SAD; i.e., the social inhibition stereotype and the oddity stereotype), and interpersonal outcomes. We performed a secondary data analysis on a sample of participants with SAD (<i>n</i> = 75) and without SAD (<i>n</i> = 60) who completed multiple study visits, including diagnostic interviews, and brought friends (<i>n</i> = 91) and romantic partners (<i>n</i> = 61) into the study. To investigate effects of endorsing stereotypes of SAD on relationship satisfaction, we examined participant self-report ratings of relationship satisfaction as well as friend- and romantic partner-reported ratings. Higher endorsement of the social inhibition stereotype was associated with lower participant self-reported friendship satisfaction but was not associated with friend-reported ratings. Neither endorsement of social inhibition nor endorsement of oddity predicted participant-reported or partner-reported romantic relationship ratings. Neither endorsement of the social inhibition nor oddity stereotype was associated with self-reported number of interpersonal problems due to coldness, but higher endorsement of the social inhibition stereotype was associated with more self-reported interpersonal problems due to submissiveness. Our results suggest that: (1) of the two stereotypes, the social inhibition stereotype may be more predictive of interpersonal variables among those with SAD; (2) SAD stereotype endorsement is associated with self-reported relationship satisfaction among those with SAD, but is not associated with partner-reported ratings; and (3) SAD stereotype endorsement may not predict interpersonal outcomes among individuals with SAD to the extent that we originally hypothesized.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of birthing individuals delivering from January 1, 2017, to March 1, 2020, in Louisiana. We identified patients with postpartum readmission for hypertension (readmission within 30 days of delivery) and compared BP and clinical and sociodemographic characteristics with those of patients who were not readmitted for hypertension. Patients were also grouped by their BP at both admission for delivery and 36 hours postpartum: systolic below 130 mm Hg and diastolic below 80 mm Hg, systolic 130-139 mm Hg or diastolic 80-89 mm Hg, systolic 140-149 mm Hg or diastolic 90-99 mm Hg, and systolic 150 mm Hg or higher or diastolic 100 mm Hg or higher. Logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for postpartum readmission for hypertension. In our cohort of 17,587 individuals, 329 patients (1.9%) experienced postpartum readmission for hypertension. Increased admission BP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.26, 95% CI, 1.75-2.928), increased 36-hour postpartum BP (aOR 2.36, 95% CI, 1.58-3.53), and preeclampsia (aOR 2.47, 95% CI, 1.83-3.34) were the strongest predictors of postpartum readmission for hypertension. Black race, anemia, and increased maternal age also significantly increased the odds of postpartum readmission for hypertension (all <i>P</i><.001). Elevated BP on admission for delivery showed a stepwise increased incidence of postpartum readmission for hypertension (percent readmitted among the four admission BP groups: 6.0%, 2.8%, 1.6%, and 0.7% in the 150/100 mm Hg or higher group [highest], 140-149/90-99 mm Hg group, 130-139/80-89 mm Hg group, and less than 130/80 mm Hg group [lowest], respectively). Even mildly elevated BP at delivery admission and persisting postpartum significantly increased risk for postpartum readmission for hypertension.",

We aimed to explore the associations of serum HDL-C levels with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who underwent coronary angiography using a real-life clinical database. We utilized the Cholesterol and Angiography (Chol-Angio) Registry, which comprised data on 3057 cardiac patients who had undergone invasive diagnostic and interventional procedures. Multivariable linear regression models were employed to examine the relationships between serum HDL-C and the presence and extent of coronary atherosclerosis, with stratification by statin usage. Significant stenosis (70-100 % stenosis degree) was most prevalent in the proximal segments of the major coronary arteries, affecting 49.4 % of all documented findings (0-100 % stenosis degree). Serum HDL-C levels were inversely associated with the presence of coronary atherosclerosis, across different segments of the coronary arteries: Betas (95 % CI) of -0.0584 (-0.0871, -0.0297) and -0.0579 (-0.0866, -0.0291) for left main or proximal left ascending coronary artery without and with adjustment for statin use, respectively. There was an inverse dose-response relationship between of HDL-C levels and severity of coronary atherosclerosis in both statin users and non-statin users. However, the extent of coronary atherosclerosis was lower among non-statin users across all serum HDL-C levels. In patients undergoing coronary angiography, serum HDL-C levels are inversely associated with the presence and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. The inverse association between serum HDL-C levels and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is not modified by statins use and is consistent with a dose-response relationship.",

    "abstract": "Denosumab,a monoclonal IgG2 antibody,is used as neoadjuvant therapy for giant cell bone tumors, particularly in inoperable or metastatic cases. It targets the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (RANKL),which is overexpressed in tumor stromal cells.However,denosumab treatment can lead to side effects such as hypocalcemia during treatment and rarely but malignant hypercalcemia after discontinuation. The unpredictable onset time and persistent course of hypercalcemia attacks increase the duration of hospitalization and the risk of complications. A 9-year-old girl with a giant cell bone tumor was treated with denosumab for diffuse tumor recurrence. Severe hypercalcemia occurred four months after completing therapy. Evaluation suggested \"rebound-linked\" hypercalcemia following denosumab discontinuation. IV bisphosphonate treatment normalized calcium levels initially, but hypercalcemia recurred, requiring repeated IV bisphosphonate administration. Oral alendronate was used weekly to prevent further attacks, resulting in stable calcium levels during follow-up. Rebound hypercalcemia, as an unpredictable recurrent episode at any time, is a potential complication of denosumab cessation, and requires close monitoring post-treatment. Children may be at higher risk due to their rapid bone cycle. In long-term follow-up, IV and oral biphosphonates can be used effectively in the management of especially life-threatening recurrent attacks.",

This scoping review aimed to characterize TIS intervention components and implementation strategies described in published studies of TIS. This review also examined the extent to which published examples of TIS had an explicit focus on promoting racial equity. Eligible studies described school- or district-wide trauma-informed approaches in Preschool-12 education, and included elements across at least two domains of TIS design: Organizational & Policy Reforms; Workforce Professional Development/Training; and Educational & Clinical Practices. A trained coding team reviewed eligible studies and applied 32 codes characterizing TIS intervention components and implementation strategies. 30 eligible studies were identified. The most common <i>implementation strategies</i> included availability of trauma-informed training & consultation, implementation progress monitoring, and developing community partnerships. The most common <i>intervention components</i> included multi-tiered interventions and specific knowledge areas for trauma-informed training content. Least common, were <i>intervention components</i> related to promoting racial equity (e.g., de-implementation of exclusionary discipline, de-implementation of carceral practices, and culturally inclusive curriculum). Findings suggest TIS components related to implementation strategies are most frequently employed, and that explicit attention to racial equity was infrequent in published descriptions of TIS design and implementation.",

The main outcomes examined were incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia, need for permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion, and neurologic outcomes at discharge that were compared to currently published standards. <b>Results</b>  We failed to appreciate a reduced occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia (37.3% with the current literature supporting rates of 20-30%); however, we did find a low rate of requiring permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion (12% compared to 10-20% in the current literature) with overall good neurologic outcomes at discharge (∼69% of patients had a Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] of 4-5 at discharge). Patients with GOS ≥ 4 at discharge were noted to be more likely to have more days or lumbar drainage and less likely to be older than 65 years, have had an external ventricular drain placed, and have experienced delayed cerebral ischemia. <b>Conclusion</b>  Lumbar drainage is a potentially useful adjunct in the management of secondary neurologic injury in subarachnoid hemorrhage.",

Yet, despite evidence that RC text-structure intervention improves RC, transfer to WPS has not been investigated. Similarly, despite evidence that WPS text-structure intervention improves WPS, transfer to RC has not been examined. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to assess effects of single-domain text-structure intervention (RC <i>or</i> WPS intervention) for simultaneously improving RC <i>and</i> WPS. Second-grade children with comorbid learning difficulty across RC and WPS were randomly assigned to 3 conditions: RC text-structure intervention (RC.INT), WPS text-structure intervention (WP.INT), or the standard school program (the control group). Inferential tests for acquisition effects in multilevel models were significant. RC.INT's effect sizes (vs. control) on RC were <i>g</i> = 1.16 and 0.83; WP.INT's ESs (vs. control) on WPS were <i>g</i> = 1.36 and 1.05.

    "title": "Endoscopic third ventriculostomy for hydrocephalus associated with cerebellar arteriovenous malformation: A case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are abnormal arteriovenous shunt lesions that predominantly occur in the brain or spinal cord. However, obstructive hydrocephalus resulting from an unruptured AVM occurs rarely. Herein, we report the case of a patient with obstructive hydrocephalus caused by an unruptured cerebellar AVM that was treated with an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), and further, we present a literature review. An 11-year-old girl presented to our department with headache, nausea, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed a cerebellar AVM. Additionally, we used the findings of digital subtraction angiography and confirmed a Spetzler-Martin grade 5 cerebellar AVM fed by branches of the bilateral posterior cerebral and bilateral anterior and posterior cerebellar arteries. We initiated conservative therapy; however, 10 years after her initial presentation, the patient's acute obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal occlusion had worsened. Therefore, we performed an endoscopic third ventriculostomy that resolved the hydrocephalus and improved the patient's clinical condition. In our review of the literature, we observed that, in most cases, hydrocephalus resulted from deep-seated AVM; furthermore, ETV effectively resolved the hydrocephalus. To summarize, ETV can be an effective alternative to emergent ventriculoperitoneal shunting to treat acute obstructive hydrocephalus caused by unruptured intracranial AVM.",

    "title": "A comparison between the impacts of lecture and game based teaching on moral sensitivity among nursing students.",
    "abstract": "Effective educational strategies are crucial for developing moral sensitivity in nursing students. Traditional lecture-based methods may lack engagement, prompting the exploration of game-based approaches. This study compares the impacts of game-based and lecture-based teaching on nursing students' moral sensitivity. In this quasi-experimental study, 46 fourth-semester nursing students from Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences participated. The control group received traditional lectures, while the intervention group engaged in game-based learning focused on moral scenarios in eight 90-minute sessions. Of the initial 46 students, 42 completed the study. Both groups had similar demographics. Post-intervention, the game-based group showed a statistically significant increase in total moral sensitivity scores (<i>P</i> = 0.017). Additionally, they scored higher in \"experience of ethical problems and conflicts\" (<i>P</i> = 0.044) and in \"sincerity and benevolence\" (<i>P</i> = 0.007) compared to the lecture group. It was concluded that game-based teaching methods significantly enhance moral sensitivity among nursing students compared to traditional lectures, particularly in areas related to ethical conflicts and benevolence. Future research should focus on the long-term effects and integration of game-based learning in nursing education.",

    "title": "THE GAP BETWEEN GUIDELINES AND PRACTICE: THE NEED TO DE-ESCALATE INTENSITY OF TREATMENT FOR DIFFERENTIATED THYROID CANCER.",
    "abstract": "Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) generally has an excellent prognosis, yet treatment strategies have traditionally been aggressive, often involving total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation and long-term suppressive levothyroxine therapy even in cases considered to be low- or intermediate-risk. In recent years, several guidelines have recommended a more individualized, risk-based approach aiming for a more conservative treatment plan. Despite this paradigm shift, there is a gap between recommendations and actual clinical practice as many centers continue to advocate the more aggressive treatment model. De-escalating the care of selected patients with thyroid cancer include the avoidance of surgery in tumours < 10 mm, the recommendation for thyroid lobectomy for tumours < 4cm, the avoidance of prophylactic lymph node dissection. Evidence based studies show that such strategies do not worsen long-term outcomes, can reduce complications and can lead to better quality of life. Such studies will be summarised in this editorial with the aim of encouraging clinicians to reconsider established treatment protocols and empowering patients to make informed decisions for their care.",

Alloantibodies against low-frequency antigens pose a risk of potential hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease in fetuses and newborns. We describe a technique of \"Nonspecific alloadsorption\" to identify a suspected antibody to a low-frequency antigen in the presence of an interfering autoantibody. A 15-year-old thalassaemic reported to our blood bank with an inability to find compatible blood units. There was a presence of an allo-antibody with auto-antibody. We attempted a \"non-specific allo adsorption\" for identifying an interfering allo-antibody against a low-frequency antigen. Our case report highlights that understanding the basic antigenic frequencies of various antigens can play an important role in antibody identification. It is always important to exclude alloantibody when autoantibody or AIHA scenarios are presented in thalassemia patients for safe transfusions.",

    "abstract": "This scoping review examined quantitative research comparing involuntary inpatient groups with voluntary inpatients or other comparator group. Ten themes were identified: patient knowledge of legal status, experienced or perceived coercion, effects on medication use, clinical effects measured on outcome scales, effects on psychiatric readmission, use of restraints and seclusion, effects on suicide and deaths, patient satisfaction, length of stay and carer experiences. The review found that involuntary inpatient admission was associated with harms including increased subjective and objective coercion, increased cost and decreased patient satisfaction. In addition, it found that there may be significant confusion among both voluntary and involuntary patients regarding their legal rights. However, patients admitted on an involuntary basis experienced greater improvements in symptoms and function, possibly due to greater symptom burden prior to admission. Involuntary treatment carries the potential for both benefit and harms that should be acknowledged and mitigated by service providers.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium has been used as an adjuvant to general anaesthesia owing to its multiple benefits, including potentiating the action of rocuronium. However, magnesium may affect neostigmine-induced neuromuscular blockade recovery. The effects of intraoperative magnesium administration on residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) were investigated. This retrospective study reviewed the data of adult patients who underwent general anaesthesia with rocuronium as the neuromuscular blocking agent and neostigmine as the reversal agent, between 2018 and 2020. RNMB was defined as the administration of an additional reversal agent (neostigmine or sugammadex) in the post-anaesthesia care unit. The incidence of RNMB was compared between magnesium and control groups, and logistic regression analysis identified risk factors. Of 61,471 patients, 23,523 were included in the logistic regression analysis. After propensity score matching, 5166 patients from each group were compared, and RNMB incidence was comparable between the magnesium and control groups. In the logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for RNMB were older age (odds ratio: 1.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.03; p<0.001), male gender (1.72; 1.33-2.23; p<0.001), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (2.08; 1.54-2.82; p<0.001), limb surgery (1.46; 1.01-2.12; p=0.042), volatile anaesthetics, sevoflurane (1.84; 1.27-2.66; p=0.001), and intraoperative hypothermia (1.58; 1.13-2.23; p=0.008). Magnesium increased the risk of RNMB in patients anesthetized by propofol (2.22; 1.46-3.38; p<0.001) and sevoflurane (2.57; 1.60-4.11; p<0.001), but not desflurane (p≥0.05). Intraoperative magnesium increases the risk of RNMB in patients anesthetized with propofol and sevoflurane, and should be used with caution depending on the type of general anaesthetic agent administered.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize healthcare. Ophthalmology-specific LLMs remain scarce and underexplored. We introduced an open-source, specialized LLM for ophthalmology, termed Language Enhanced Model for Eye (LEME). LEME was initially pre-trained on the Llama2 70B framework and further fine-tuned with a corpus of ~127,000 non-copyrighted training instances curated from ophthalmology-specific case reports, abstracts, and open-source study materials. We benchmarked LEME against eight other LLMs, namely, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, three Llama2 models (7B, 13B, 70B), PMC-LLAMA 13B, Meditron 70B, and EYE-Llama (another ophthalmology-specific LLM). Evaluations included four internal validation tasks: abstract completion, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice questions (MCQ), and short-answer QA. External validation tasks encompassed long-form QA, MCQ, patient EHR summarization, and clinical QA. Evaluation metrics included Rouge-L scores, accuracy, and expert evaluation of correctness, completeness, and readability. In internal validations, LEME consistently outperformed its counterparts, achieving Rouge-L scores of 0.20 ± 0.03 in abstract completion (all p<0.05), 0.82 ± 0.04 in fill-in-the-blank (all p<0.0001), and 0.22 ± 0.05 in short-answer QA (all p<0.0001, except versus GPT-4). In external validations, LEME excelled in long-form QA with a Rouge-L of 0.19 ± 0.01 (all p<0.0001), ranked second in MCQ accuracy (0.68 ± 0.09; all p<0.0001), and scored highest in EHR summarization and clinical QA (ranging from 4.24 to 4.83 out of 5 for correctness, completeness, and readability). LEME's emphasis on robust fine-tuning and the use of non-copyrighted data represents a breakthrough in open-source ophthalmology-specific LLMs, offering the potential to revolutionize execution of clinical tasks while democratizing research collaboration.",

    "title": "16S rRNA gene sequencing reveals bacterial diversity in Khewra Salt Mine walls.",
    "abstract": "The Khewra Salt Mine, also known as the source of Himalayan Pink Salt, is the second largest salt mine in the world and a significant site for salt export. The mine's salt exhibits both amorphous and crystalline textures, with colours ranging from white to deep red, contributing to its distinctive pink hue. While previous research has extensively explored the mine's soil, plants and brine samples, little attention has been given to the salt walls, which are a major tourist attraction. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial diversity within the salt walls from four distinct locations, including an under-construction area sampled for the first time. From these four collection points, 7 samples were gathered, yielding 19 isolates cultured on 2% NaCl nutrient agar. Bacterial isolates from the under-construction area (US1-1, US1-2, US2-1 and US2-2) and the museum walls (MS1-1 and MS1-2) underwent further biochemical, antibiotic sensitivity and salt requirement testing, followed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Biochemical assays identified these isolates as Gram-positive, catalase- and oxidase-positive rods. All isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol (30 µg ml<sup>-1</sup>). Salt tolerance tests classified them as slightly halophilic, thriving at 2-4% NaCl concentrations. Molecular characterization revealed two strains from the under-construction area, US1-1 and US2-2, as uncultured <i>Bacillus</i> species clone 5 and <i>Bacillus</i> sp. PSA3, respectively, both with 94% sequence similarity. The phylogenetic results show monophyletic associations between these two strains, which could be due to their shared salt location and common ancestors. The sequences of US1-2, US2-1 and MS1-1 were 100% identical to <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> strain P8_B2 chromosome, while MS1-2 matched <i>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</i> strain CJJH1 with 100% similarity. The results of this study point towards a significant diversity of bacteria, slightly halophilic, cocci or bacillus-shaped. These halophilic bacterial strains, possessing salt-tolerant genes, present the need for further identification of bacterial colonies in the mine and their evolutionary patterns, which could also help uncover the role these microbes play in the ecosystem of the salt mine. Additionally, they show promise for industrial enzyme production.",

    "abstract": "Molecular sequence variation at a locus informs about the evolutionary history of the sample and past population size dynamics. The Kingman coalescent is used in a generative model of molecular sequence variation to infer evolutionary parameters. However, it is well understood that inference under this model does not scale well with sample size. Here, we build on recent work based on a lower resolution coalescent process, the Tajima coalescent, to model longitudinal samples. While the Kingman coalescent models the ancestry of labeled individuals, we model the ancestry of individuals labeled by their sampling time. We propose a new inference scheme for the reconstruction of effective population size trajectories based on this model and the infinite-sites mutation model. Modeling of longitudinal samples is necessary for applications (<i>e.g.</i>, ancient DNA and RNA from rapidly evolving pathogens like viruses) and statistically desirable (variance reduction and parameter identifiability). We propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the likelihood and employ a Bayesian nonparametric procedure to infer the population size trajectory. We provide a new MCMC sampler to explore the space of heterochronous Tajima's genealogies and model parameters. We compare our procedure with state-of-the-art methodologies in simulations and an application to ancient bison DNA sequences.",

    "abstract": "U.S. females live longer than males due to a range of social, psychological, behavioral, and health factors. Prior research has underscored unhealthy behaviors as particularly risky for males and lower socioeconomic status as a risk factor for females in shaping sex differences in adult mortality. But this research has largely examined mortality during mid- and older-adulthood, with most deaths occurring at older ages. Our study focuses on sex differences in mortality among a cohort of U.S. adolescents followed into adulthood, ages 12-46 (N=18,921). We employ Cox proportional hazard models and data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which was recently linked to mortality records through December of 2021. The hazard of dying is much greater (HR=1.69; p<.001) for male compared to female adolescents and young adults, with larger disparities for external compared to internal causes of death. Sex differences in mortality are reduced but persist when controlling for childhood experiences, health behaviors, risky behaviors, and social ties. The relatively poor mental and physical health of females suppresses the differences; that is, sex differences in mortality would be even larger were it not for the poorer mental and physical health of young females compared with males. The findings point to risk factors that if improved could reduce mortality for both U.S. males and females, while reducing sex differences in mortality among younger adults. Such improvements could increase life expectancy of the U.S. population and reduce mortality and sex differences at older ages.",

    "abstract": "Hypomagnesemia, a common condition, frequently goes unnoticed due to varying symptom severity. In the hospital setting, the link between adverse drug reactions and hypomagnesemia is not always clear, and some drug labels omit this risk, compounding the potential danger. We conducted a cross-sectional study by mining data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) covering Q1 2004 to Q4 2023. Using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, we identified cases of hypomagnesemia, determined the signal drugs causing hypomagnesemia based on the drug name, and employed descriptive and disproportionality analysis methods for signal detection. From 17,381,220 adverse event reports, 11,228 individual safety reports (ISRs) involving hypomagnesemia were identified. Omeprazole led with 1,556 reports (20.75%), followed by pantoprazole, panitumumab, cetuximab, and esomeprazole. Disproportionality analysis revealed necitumumab as the drug with the strongest signal, followed by capreomycin, panitumumab, pantoprazole, and omeprazole. Among the top 50 drugs from the disproportionality analysis, 31 signal drugs had labels that did not mention the risk of hypomagnesemia. We issue warnings regarding drugs associated with specific combination therapies that cause adverse reactions leading to hypomagnesemia. Furthermore, to delve deeper into the relationship between drugs and hypomagnesemia, reliance on more credible research in this field is required.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using electron density (ED) maps combined with Z-effective (Zeff) images obtained from unenhanced dual-layer dual-energy CT (dl-DECT) scans of the chest for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE). A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent for contrast-enhanced chest CT (CECT) clinically suspected of PE or acute aortic syndrome. These scans were performed on a single dl-DECT scanner between October 2021 and November 2023. To distinguish emboli from circulating blood, color-coded maps were generated from the ED dataset superimposed on Zeff images, which were acquired from the unenhanced phase. Two radiologists with different levels of expertise independently assessed the presence of PE in the generated ED-Zeff maps, blinded to CECT results, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy of ED-Zeff maps was assessed for each reader. The final study cohort comprised 150 patients, with 92 males (mean age: 68 ± 10 years, range: 47-93 years) and 58 females (mean age: 66 ± 15 years, range 38-89 years). ED-Zeff maps demonstrated high diagnostic performance, yielding accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively, of 86.67% (113/150, 95% CI, 80.16%-91.66%), 85% (17/20, 95% CI, 79.89%-92.19%), and 86.92% (113/130, 95% CI, 79.89%-92.19%). Ed-Zeff maps were able to identify PE in 85% of positive cases. Cohen's kappa coefficient indicated excellent intra- and interobserver agreement (κ ≥ 0.9). ED maps combined with Zeff images from unenhanced dl-DECT scans represent a feasible tool for detecting PE and may prove useful in evaluating patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast.",

    "abstract": "Infertility affects an estimated 17.5% of couples worldwide, according to the last report published in 2023 by WHO. A significant cause of this global fertility decline is due to environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals exposure, which have the ability to interfere with the endocrine system. Bisphenol A (BPA), a synthetic chemical product leads to health concerns for its endocrine-disrupting properties. Jujube honey contains antioxidants and active compounds, has various therapeutic properties. This study aims to determine testicular dysfunction and endocrine imbalance induced by BPA chronic exposure and the possible protective effect of jujube honey in gerbil. Eighteen adult male gerbil was either considered as control (n=6, group 1) or exposed to 50 mg BPA/kg/day Group 2, n=6) and the BPA-treated group was given jujube honey at 200 mg/kg/day by oral gavage Group 3, n=6) for six weeks. At the end of the experiment, testicular weight, epididymal sperm count, endocrine status, histopathology of testis tissue and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated. The results showed a decrease in testicular weight, sperm quality and plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol in the BPA-treated group. Furthermore, histopathological findings revealed germinal epithelium alteration characterized by germ cell degeneration, disordered arrangement of the germ cell layers and vacuolization and decreased number of Ki-67-positive germ cells. The results showed a decrease in testicular levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione with an increase of malondialdehyde in the BPA-treated group. However, in the jujube honey+BPA group, histopathological studies revealed a systematic array of germ cells with less vacuolization, improved sperm parameters, restored plasma testosterone and estradiol levels and increased antioxidative capacity of the testes. These findings suggest a potential protective effect of jujube honey against BPA-induced testicular damage and oxidative stress caused by endocrine-disrupting chemicals.",

This viral candidate imposes major public health concerns with clinical manifestations including gastroenteritis, eye infections, and respiratory infections. Adenoviruses are found to be prevalent in rivers, pool waters, drinking water, and coastal waters. Adenoviruses are listed as contamination candidates for drinking water because of their survival characteristics during water treatment technologies. Therefore, it is important to monitor raw and treated water routinely for the presence of adenoviruses. PCR based molecular methods are considered most suitable for monitoring adenoviruses in environmental samples. Choosing the correct type of PCR depends on specific methods of approach and the type of viral assay. The present review summarizes the process of monitoring adenoviruses in water and wastewater through different PCR methods and their recent advancements. The review also covers a brief overview of PCR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The Syrian civil war displaced more than half of the Syrian population, including over 660,000 registered refugees who fled to neighboring Jordan. Environmental health services (e.g., water, sanitation, hygiene, and solid waste management) are critical for refugee health. Still, they may strain resources in host communities and must evolve in protracted crises. We studied environmental health services in the Azraq refugee camp in Jordan to identify the stakeholders and their roles in service provision, assess stakeholder communication and coordination, and evaluate sustainability. We conducted 25 interviews with stakeholders involved in environmental health service provision. We found that non-governmental and United Nations organizations had well-defined responsibilities, but the roles of donors, the Jordanian government, refugees, and the host community needed clarification. Conflicting standards and mismatched donor expectations with on-the-ground needs sometimes created challenges for coordinated and efficient service provision. The basic needs of refugees were generally met and services improved somewhat over time, but political obstacles and inadequate resources complicated the path toward sustainable services. Early incorporation of sustainability in planning and increased efforts to build the capacity of refugees to contribute and take ownership of environmental health services will likely enhance long-term environmental health service provision and development outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Mobile testing services provide opportunities for active surveillance of infectious diseases for hard-to-reach and/or high-risk individuals who do not know their disease status. Identifying as many infected individuals as possible is important for mitigating disease transmission. Recently, multi-armed bandit sampling approaches have been adapted and applied in this setting to maximize the cumulative number of positive tests collected over time. However, these algorithms have not considered the possibility of variability in the number of tests administered across testing sites. What impact this variability has on the ability of these approaches to maximize yield is currently unknown. Therefore, we investigate this question by extending existing sampling frameworks to directly account for variability in testing volume while also maintaining the computational tractability of the previous methods. Through a simulation study based on human immunodeficiency virus infection characteristics in the Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville) as well as an application to COVID-19 testing data in Connecticut, we find improved long- and short-term performances of the new methods compared to several existing approaches. Based on these findings and the ease of computation, we recommend use of the newly developed methods for active surveillance of infectious diseases when variability in testing volume may be present.",

    "abstract": "Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) can occur when diseases are treated with combinations of drugs, leading to changes in the pharmacological activity of these drugs. Predicting DDIs has become a crucial task in medical health. Recently, hierarchical graph representation learning methods have attracted significant interest and have proven effective for this task. However, collecting drug interaction data through biological experiments in wet laboratories is resource- and time-intensive. Given the limited amount of available drug interaction data, the performance of existing hierarchical graph methods has encountered a bottleneck. Current approaches are supervised learning methods, which train graph neural networks on specific datasets and can cause overfitting problems. Additionally, supervised learning models cannot leverage information from massive amounts of unlabeled public molecular datasets, such as ZINC15. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method for multi-view graph representation learning, namely, Self-Supervised Multi-View Graph Representation Learning for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction (SMG-DDI). SMG-DDI leverages a pre-trained Graph Convolutional Network to generate inter-view molecule graph representations, incorporating atoms as nodes and chemical bonds as edges. Subsequently, SMG-DDI captures intra-view interactions between molecules. The final drug-drug interactions will be based on the drug embeddings from intra-view analyses. Our experiments conducted on various real datasets demonstrate that molecular structure information can aid in predicting potential drug-drug interactions, and our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art DDI prediction methods. The accuracies are 0.83, 0.79, and 0.73 on small, medium, and large scale test datasets, respectively.",

This study explores whether American PSCs adopt All Rise's 10 best practice principles based on surveys from a larger study of PSC operations reported by local (<i>n</i> = 849) and state (<i>n</i> = 42) PSC coordinators. Of the All Rise principles captured in our study, only 4% of courts adopted eight EBPs whereas 56% of courts adopted four to six EBPs. PSCs using EBPs employed diversified staff positions, collaborated with multiple treatment providers, participated in treatment trainings, offered peer navigators, used validated screening tools, used varied treatment modals, and had eligibility criteria for participants to enter PSC programs. PSCs' operations were generally backed by some of All Rise's best practices.",

Results showed there was a significant relationship between rape myth acceptance and negative perceptions of the #MeToo movement. Moreover, the subcategories of the IRMAS, 'it wasn't really rape' and 'she lied', had the biggest relationship and effect on opinions about the #MeToo movement. This might suggest that dismissal and disregard of abusive acts, linked to gender stereotypes, is associated with the resistance towards the #metoo movement.",

    "abstract": "To define risk factors, obstetric morbidity, and allograft outcomes associated with an unintended pregnancy after kidney transplant. This is a retrospective cohort study of pregnancies in women after kidney transplantation enrolled in the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International with births between 1967 and 2019, with cohorts categorized as intended pregnancies and unintended pregnancies. The primary outcome was acute kidney rejection during pregnancy or by 6 weeks postpartum. Secondary outcomes included allograft loss, severe maternal morbidity, and neonatal composite morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed, with adjustment for covariates pertinent to allograft function. Among 1,723 pregnancies of kidney transplant recipients, 1,081 (62.7%) were intended and 642 (37.3%) were unintended pregnancies. Risk factors for unintended pregnancy included younger age, Black race, nulliparity, chronic hypertension, and transplant from a deceased donor. Exposure to mycophenolate products (16.0% vs 5.7%) and termination (4.7% vs 0.4%) were more common in unintended pregnancies (<i>P</i><.001). Unintended pregnancy was not associated with acute kidney rejection (2.3% vs 0.9%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.38, 95% CI, 0.91-6.30, <i>P</i>=.08). Unintended pregnancy was independently associated with allograft loss at 2 years from the end of pregnancy (8.1% vs 3.5%, AOR 2.27, 95% CI, 1.32-3.94, <i>P</i>=.003) but not allograft survival (adjusted hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI, 1.00-1.49, <i>P</i>=.05). There were no differences in severe maternal morbidity (3.3% vs 3.6%) or neonatal composite morbidity (12.9% vs 14.3%) by pregnancy intention. Unintended pregnancy was not associated with acute kidney allograft rejection in the peripartum period, but it was associated with mycophenolate exposure and allograft loss at 2 years from pregnancy. The same social vulnerabilities that underlie difficulty in accessing reproductive care may be similarly important for transplant health. We recommend prepregnancy counseling and longitudinal follow-up of transplant recipients to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy and to optimize transplantation success over time.",

This study aimed to develop an ethical guideline for the use and documentation of audiovisual recordings of patients in Iran. The study was conducted in three phases: (I) a literature review, (II) focus group discussions, and (III) expert panel sessions. Participants were selected based on their willingness to participate in focus group meetings and a minimum of five years of experience in the field. Conventional content analysis was used for the focus group discussions, while directed content analysis was applied to the expert panel sessions. The guideline comprises two sections: \"general ethical considerations\", which includes 43 items, and \"specific ethical considerations\", which contains 18 items. The \"general ethical considerations\" section addresses ethical issues to be considered before, during, and after making audiovisual recordings of patients. The \"specific ethical considerations\" section focuses on ethical principles related to audiovisual recordings involving children and adolescents, cadavers, and patients with impaired decision-making capacity. This ethical guideline aims to address emerging ethical and legal challenges and to ensure that healthcare professionals' behaviors align with established ethical principles and societal expectations. Furthermore, it can serve as a valuable resource for developing assessment tools and training students in clinical settings.",

The prescription of the metered-dose inhalers resulted in between 24,889,141 and 60,878,728 tons of CO2-eq released into the atmosphere in Brazil (equivalent to traveling 23 to 57 million times the north-to-south distance of Brazil in a standard gasoline car); and between 459,830 and 1,151,008 tons of CO2-eq in the city of Porto Alegre. The study demonstrated the substantial amount of GreenHouse Gas emissions associated with these devices in Brazil. The substitution with dry powder inhalers or Soft mist inhalers in appropriate situations would prevent significant environmental harm, while also providing clinical benefits to patients, as they are currently the first-line choice recommended by clinical guidelines for the treatment of respiratory diseases.",

    "abstract": "This psychometric study adapted and validated a scale to assess teachers' knowledge of healthy eating. After selecting an instrument (GAB1), its wording was adapted to the school environment and the clarity, importance and relevance of the 16 statements were assessed. Teachers' responses to the adapted questionnaire were analysed using a three-parameter logistic model based on Item Response Theory. Assessment of parameters for retaining or excluding statements from the scale was followed by analysis of fit. Levels of interpretation of the scale were proposed and descriptive analyses were carried out to characterise the teachers. The statements presented satisfactory clarity, importance and relevance. After analysing the teachers' responses, the final 10-item model returned adequate goodness-of-fit (RMSEA = 0.012; SRMSR = 0.042; TLI = 0.99 and CFI = 0.99). Three levels of knowledge were identified: food choice; from food to meals; and food and nutrition education. Teachers who worked in schools where healthy eating was included in programme content were more knowledgeable. The GAB1-professores scale contributes to planning and evaluating teacher qualification processes.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative assessment of blood flow in peripheral extremities in conjunction with simultaneous CT angiography measurements can improve risk assessment and provide a critical decision-making tool for patients across a wide spectrum of vascular disease severity. This study assessed the reproducibility and accuracy of lower extremity blood flow measurements with a low-dose first-pass analysis CT perfusion technique. This prospective study utilized 16 Yorkshire Swine to obtain lower extremity blood flow CT measurements at baseline and under induced femoral stenosis using a vascular occluder. Thirty-three pairs of CT measurements evaluated reproducibility, and 43 CT measurements assessed accuracy against ultrasound flow probe references. Contrast agent and saline chaser were both injected peripherally at a rate of 5 mL/s. Bolus tracking was used, and a pre-contrast and post-contrast helical scan were acquired at the base and approximately the peak of the femoral enhancement (CT angiogram), respectively. The acquired data were then used as analytical inputs into a first-pass analysis model to derive perfusion in mL/min/g. The reproducibility and accuracy of lower extremity perfusion measurements were assessed via Mixed model regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Calculated CT perfusion measurements derived from first-pass analysis technique (<i>P</i> <sub>CT</sub>), and the reference standard ultrasound perfusion measurements (<i>P</i> <sub>ref</sub>) were related by <i>P</i> <sub>CT</sub> = 1.06 <i>P</i> <sub>ref</sub> + 0.00 (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.90, Root-Mean-Square Error [RMSE] = 0.01 mL/min/g). The first (<i>P</i> <sub>1</sub>) and second (<i>P</i> <sub>2</sub>) CT perfusion measurements were related by <i>P</i> <sub>2</sub> = 0.98 <i>P</i> <sub>1</sub> + 0.02 (<i>r</i> = 0.97, RMSE = 0.11 mL/min/g). The average effective dose of perfusion measurement using first-pass analysis technique was calculated to be only 2.13 mSv. The low-dose quantitative CT perfusion technique can accurately measure lower extremity perfusion (mL/min/g) using only 2 helical scans. The CT angiogram and perfusion measurements can be used as a comprehensive technique for morphological and physiological assessment of limb ischemia.",

At ages 18, 21, 26, 32, 38, and 45, past-year AD prevalence was 11.0%, 18.4%, 13.6%, 8.1%, 9.6%, and 11.3%, respectively. As expected, relative to never-diagnosed individuals, those with early-onset AD (first diagnosis: age-18 or age-21, prevalence=22.9%) were distinguished by a range of early-life and adult correlates. Individuals with midlife-onset AD (first diagnosis: age-38 or age-45, prevalence=5.6%) were distinguished by fewer early-life correlates, but exhibited a family history of AD, and adolescent dysregulation and marijuana-use. They were characterized by an array of adult correlates, including internalizing disorders, mental-health treatment-contact, criminal-behavior, perceived-stress, coping-by-drinking, lower likelihood of marriage and parenthood, and reduced preparedness for old age. They also experienced more adult alcohol-related impairment than the early-onset group. Results can guide efforts to reduce midlife alcohol-related problems and support healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Qingre huazhuo tang (QRHZT) is a traditional Chinese medicine decoction that has been used clinically by traditional Chinese medicine masters for more than 50 years with good results. However, its mechanism is unknown, and further elucidation is necessary. To verify the mechanism by which QRHZT regulates IgA nephropathy through immune checkpoints and ferroptosis by combining network pharmacology, single-cell sequencing and experimental studies. The single-cell sequencing data obtained from podocytes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) patients were screened, and the QRHZT target information was obtained from the ETCM database. Moreover, the KEGG, GSEA, immune checkpoint and ferroptosis data were analyzed and plotted using R language. Finally, the relevant immune checkpoint and ferroptosis targets were validated experimentally. QRHZT can regulate IgAN through the immune checkpoints FIT, FTH1, AKR1C3, and IL6 and the ferroptosis-related genes PVR and IFNG. QRHZT has the potential to regulate IgAN, and omics strategies combined with network pharmacology is a feasible method for exploring the mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicines.",

    "abstract": "Court-ordered treatment for offenders who suffer from psychiatric disorders or addiction has been the subject of controversy in all Western countries, but opposition in France has been more widespread than elsewhere. Based on 100 interviews, this article nonetheless reveals that healthcare professionals have gradually accepted court-ordered treatment, which they provide both inside and outside correctional facilities. We argue that, with few exceptions, they now agree that given offenders' frequent unwillingness to seek treatment, constraint can lead to creating a therapeutic alliance, although it is a complex process that involves employing a variety of techniques. To overcome offenders' suspicions that they are working with the courts, they claim to be complete outsiders who keep their distance from the judicial system and its expectations. We find that, despite greater acceptance of court-ordered treatment, these professionals perpetuate France's distinctive system and fuel the growing criticism from prosecutors, judges, and corrections system personnel.",

    "abstract": "Making a person with quadruple amputation walk again is a challenging task for the rehabilitation team. Quadruple amputation secondary to symmetrical peripheral gangrene is a rare clinical scenario posing challenges in rehabilitation. Literature regarding rehabilitation of persons with multiple amputations is limited. This case describes the rehabilitation of a 57-year-old lady suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia who underwent quadruple amputation. She had undergone bilateral transtibial and bilateral transradial amputation after vasopressor-induced symmetrical peripheral gangrene. In view of expected guarded level of functional independence, ambulatory independence was the primary goal at admission to Department of PMR. The various steps taken in rehabilitation and modifications made to assistive devices are described in this article. Challenges faced during various phases of training, and subsequent ambulation are detailed in this article. Overcoming limitations, the client was made to be an indoor ambulator with appropriate prostheses and mobility aids. She was partially independent for activities of daily life after in-patient rehabilitation. The background of leukaemia and subsequent chemotherapy also affected the rehabilitation of this patient. Although various studies have described cases of quadruple amputation rehabilitation achieving functional independence and ambulation, the absence of specific guidelines and protocols make rehabilitation of persons with multiple amputations inefficient. This case study also shows the need for personalized goal setting for persons with multiple amputations. Realistic goal setting, psychological counselling, and an interdisciplinary approach are imperative in rehabilitation of persons with quadruple amputation. Flexible functional scales specific to persons with multiple amputations are necessary to evaluate such persons objectively. Studies with larger sample size, longer follow-ups, and comprehensive review of existing literature are needed to standardize rehabilitation of quadruple amputation and evaluate the various factors that may affect rehabilitation outcome.",

    "abstract": "Globally, stroke is a major contributor to disability and a leading cause of death. Stroke is more frequent in underdeveloped countries, where ischemic stroke is one of the most common kinds. Therefore, it is imperative to unravel the processes of ischemic stroke in more depth and develop novel therapeutics to combat the condition. Polyphenols provide a significant preventive role against multiple diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, atherosclerosis, brain dysfunction, and stroke. In the current investigation, computational tools including Swiss Target prediction, DisGeNET, SwissADME, pkCSM, Cytoscape, InterActiVenn, STRING database, and DAVID database were utilized to identify the signaling pathways, putative targets, along with associated genes of the polyphenols for stroke prevention. This study revealed the possible interactions between the disease targets for Stroke and the selected plant-based polyphenols. Docking results also exhibited the strong to moderate affinity of the selected ligands (Apigenin, Ellagic acid, Ferulic acid, Kaempferol, Genistein, Luteolin, Naringenin, and Quercetin) towards the selected disease target. This study highlights the neuroprotective role of selected polyphenols through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Further studies are required to investigate additional molecular mechanisms between the polyphenols and their derivatives against pathological targets of Stroke.",

    "abstract": "To compare surgical outcomes among patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications with minimally invasive gynecologic surgery subspecialists (MIGS group), gynecologic oncologists (GO group), and general obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYN group). We conducted a retrospective cohort study from a quaternary care academic hospital. We included patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign reasons from 2015 to 2020. Exclusion criteria were malignant, premalignant, or suspected malignant condition, pelvic mass (other than leiomyoma), concomitant correction of pelvic organ prolapse, and peripartum hysterectomy. The primary outcome was the odds of a composite of any intraoperative or postoperative complications by surgeon group. Secondary outcomes were conversion to laparotomy, estimated blood loss, and admission times by surgeon subspecialty. A total of 946 hysterectomies were performed during the study period, of which 356 (37.6%) were performed by obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns), 220 (23.3%) by gynecologic oncologists, and 370 (39.1%) by minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons. Abdominal hysterectomies were performed in 36.8% of cases in the OB-GYN group and 30.0% of cases in the GO group, compared with 0.3% of cases in the MIGS group (<i>P</i><.001). Intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred in 11.9% of cases in the MIGS group, 18.2% of cases in the GO group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.79, 95% CI, 1.14-2.08), and 20.8% of cases in the OB-GYN group (aOR 1.64, 95% CI, 1.01-2.69). Conversion to laparotomy occurred in 0.3% of cases in the MIGS group, 7.1% of cases in the GO group, and 7.6% of cases in the OB-GYN group (<i>P</i><.001). Estimated blood loss, total admission time from surgery to discharge, and total days of hospitalization were all lower in the MIGS group compared with the other two groups (<i>P</i><.001 for all comparisons). The aOR for same-day discharge was independently lower in the GO group (0.50, 95% CI, 0.29-0.86) and the OB-GYN group (0.23, 95% CI, 0.15-0.33) compared with the MIGS group. Fellowship-trained minimally invasive gynecologic surgery subspecialists had lower rates of perioperative complications for hysterectomy for benign indications compared with gynecologic oncologists and ob-gyns. Minimally invasive gynecologic surgery cases were also associated with fewer rates of laparotomy, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays.",

This study assesses the impact of lab test results on differential diagnoses (DDx) made by large language models (LLMs). Clinical vignettes from 50 case reports from PubMed Central were created incorporating patient demographics, symptoms, and lab results. Five LLMs-GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama-2-70b, Claude-2, and Mixtral-8×7B were tested to generate Top 10, Top 5, and Top 1 DDx with and without lab data. A comprehensive evaluation involving GPT-4, a knowledge graph, and clinicians was conducted. GPT-4 performed best, achieving 55% accuracy for Top 1 diagnoses and 60% for Top 10 with lab data, with lenient accuracy up to 80%. Lab results significantly improved accuracy, with GPT-4 and Mixtral excelling, though exact match rates were low. Lab tests, including liver function, metabolic/toxicology panels, and serology/immune tests, were generally interpreted correctly by LLMs for differential diagnosis.",

Thirty-six excerpts did not align with either framework whereas the remaining 67 aligned with one or both frameworks. We discuss common codes, differences and similarities across heterogenous focus groups and those with only students of color or White students. We also present themes that were not aligned with Double Check CARES or the Eight Competencies and discuss implications for incorporating student voice into the conceptualization of CRP and improving classroom practices.",

Renal transplantation (RTX) recipients who had been operated and followed up because of tHPT between 9/2014 and 5/2021 at our institution were retrospectively analysed. We analysed the pre-operative and postoperative data of 41 patients with tHPT. Considering IO PTH monitoring; 70% and more decrease of the hormone level leaded us favourable results (89% surgical success) regardless of the PTX method (p<0.05). We obtained the same surgical success rate (75%) in patients in whom monitoring was done and was not done. We observed high success ratios (100%) in the latter group via subtotal PTX and total PTX plus autotransplantation (AT) (p<0.05). In surgery for tHPT, IO PTH monitoring should be maintained. When we observe 70% or more decline in the hormone level, we can decide to finish the operation regardless of the surgical technique. If hormone level decrease is below 70%, we have to continue exploration.",

    "abstract": "The most serious complication of central neck dissection (CND) is inadvertent parathyroidectomy. There is no definitive method for intraoperative diagnosis of this complication. We studied on CND indicated 17 thyroid cancer patients (14 female, 3 male, age range: 21-67, mean age: 43.4). The excised CND material was kept in 50 ml of normal saline for 30 minutes. A 2 ml sample was taken from this fluid and sent to biochemistry for rapid parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement. PTH values were <10pg/mL in 14 patients. PTH values of three patients were very high (112pg/mL, 167pg/mL, 210pg/mL respectively). When the excised tissue in these patients was evaluated intraoperatively with loop glasses, one parathyroid tissue was found in each of the three cases and these were autotransplanted intramuscularly. After this procedure we kept CND tissue material again in another normal saline of 50mL in 30 minutes and PTH was measured. The values came back as <10pg/mL. No parathyroid gland was found in any case in the postoperative routine histopathological evaluation. No patient had symptoms of hypocalcemia during the eight-weeks postoperative follow-up. Inadvertent parathyroidectomy due to CND is a serious complication. This complication can be prevented with the simple method we recommend here.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the role of two candidate polymorphisms to improve the diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in forensic psychiatry settings. Individuals who applied to our unit with PTSD symptoms following a traffic accident were included. The control group consisted of people who had experienced a similar accident without any symptoms. Sociodemographic data-form, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI 3) were applied to the patients and controls, and the frequencies of the rs8042149 polymorphic allele of the RORA gene and the rs717947 polymorphic allele (4p15) were investigated. A total of 103 people were included (54 case, 49 control). The rates of polymorphisms were not different between the groups. Higher education levels were associated with lower PTSD incidence while higher scores in the Social Subscale of ASI strongly predicted the occurrence of PTSD. The polymorphisms assessed did not help to differentiate the groups in the current sample. The potential of the Social Subscale of ASI-3 in predicting the occurrence of PTSD following a trauma should be evaluated in a longitudinal design.",

However, despite such a promising future, there are multiple challenges and obstacles that remain for their real-world uses in practical settings. This work discusses key challenges for LLMs in medical applications from four unique aspects: operational vulnerabilities, ethical and social considerations, performance and assessment difficulties, and legal and regulatory compliance. Addressing these challenges is crucial for leveraging LLMs to their full potential and ensuring their responsible integration into healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a complex disease and its development is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. However, specific genetic factors associated with osteoporosis are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to identify genetic risk factors for osteoporosis. This study included 86 females with osteoporosis and 47 healthy females. We analyzed rs1800587, rs16944, rs1799814, rs4988321, rs2228570, and rs35211496 variations in IL1A, IL1B, CYP1A1, LRP5, VDR, and RANK, respectively, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Our analysis revealed that the CT and TT genotype for rs1800587 in IL1A was associated with higher bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, trochanter, Ward's triangle, and femoral neck (p=0.020, p=0.021, p=0.015, and p=0.013, respectively). The rs1800587 variation in IL1A was associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis in both dominant and codominant inheritance models (CC <i>vs</i>. CT, p=0.016 and CC <i>vs</i>. CT/TT, p=0.035, respectively). However, we did not identify any statistically significant differences in either genotype or allele frequencies between the control group and the patients with osteoporosis for the other genetic variations examined. Our findings suggest that the rs1800587 variation in IL1A gene is associated with a significantly decreased risk of osteoporosis in the Turkish population.",

Fine neddle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed on the nodules according to ultrasonographic malignancy risk, and cytopathological evaluation was performed according to the Bethesda system. We did not find any difference between the groups in terms of age, sex, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and thyroid volumes.We detected thyroid nodules in 36 (32.4%) of 111 subjects in the obese group and 22 (19.8%) of 111 subjects in the control group. Compared with controls, the prevalence of nodules was higher in obese subjects (p=0.046).There was no difference in the malignancy risk of nodules in obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects according to both ultrasonographic classification systems. We have determined that the frequency of thyroid nodules is higher in obese patients than in non-obese subjects.However, we did not find any difference between the two groups in terms of malignancy risk of thyroid nodules according to ultrasonographic classification systems.",

    "abstract": "Disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH) is a key feature of Hakim's disease (synonymous with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus; iNPH). However, it previously had been only subjectively evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of MRI indices, derived from deep learning segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, for DESH detection and to establish their optimal thresholds. This study retrospectively enrolled a total of 1009 participants, including 77 patients diagnosed with Hakim's disease, 380 healthy volunteers, 163 with mild cognitive impairment, 256 with Alzheimer's disease, and 217 with other types of neurodegenerative diseases. DESH, ventriculomegaly, tightened sulci in the high convexities, and Sylvian fissure dilatation were evaluated on three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI by radiologists. The total ventricles, high-convexity part of the subarachnoid space, and Sylvian fissure and basal cistern were automatically segmented using the CSF Space Analysis application (FUJIFILM Corporation). Moreover, DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices were calculated based on these 3 regions. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of these indices and region volumes (volume ratios) for DESH detection were calculated. Of the 1009 participants, 101 (10%) presented with DESH. The DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices performed well with 95.0%-96.0% sensitivity and 91.5%-96.8% specificity at optimal thresholds. All patients with Hakim's disease were diagnosed with DESH, despite variations in severity. In patients with Hakim's disease, with or without Alzheimer's disease, the DESH index and total ventricular volume were significantly higher compared to patients with Alzheimer's disease, although the total intracranial cerebrospinal fluid volume was significantly lower. DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices, and the volumes and volume ratios of the ventricle and high-convexity part of the subarachnoid space computed using deep learning were useful for the DESH detection that may help to improve the diagnosis of Hakim's disease (ie, iNPH).",

This retrospective cohort study included all patients who delivered in a regional hospital system from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2022. Chart abstraction identified whether urine drug testing was performed and age, race, marital status, insurance status, ZIP code, gestational age, body mass index (BMI), and delivery mode. Propensity score matching through a pregnancy risk model was used to assess the association of race, insurance status, marital status, and median income with likelihood of testing. Data were analyzed with logistic regression. Charts of 200 randomly selected patients were also evaluated for documentation of consent, testing indication, test result, and child welfare reports. Among 20,084 patients, 1,251 (6.2%) were tested, of whom 142 (11.3%) tested positive. White patients had a higher rate of positive test results (16.6%) compared with patients of other racial groups (overall rate 11.3%). None of the patients had consent documented. The most common indication for testing was limited prenatal care (48.7%). Fewer than a third of tests (28.5%) were obtained for a medical indication. The majority (67.9%) of positive results were reported to child welfare services. Risk-factor-based toxicology policies disproportionately target Black, low-income, single, publicly insured, and uninsured patients. Patients are typically not consented; testing is infrequently obtained for medical indications; and reports to child welfare services based on positive test results are common.",

SII was calculated using the formula: platelet count multiplied by the neutrophil count divided by the lymphocyte count. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between SII and obesity (β = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.20). Factors such as age, sex, education level, and smoking status significantly influenced this correlation. However, race, income-to-poverty ratio, hypertension, and diabetes did not significantly interact with the observed relationship (interaction p-value > 0.05). The study highlights a substantial link between elevated SII levels and the prevalence of obesity, indicating the potential of SII as a biomarker in obesity research. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to better understand the role of SII in the pathophysiology of obesity.",

Data were collected from 100 patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder based on the DSM-5 criteria. The use of technology was evaluated with a questionnaire developed for this study. The level of psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), and the positive and negative symptom severity was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The digital technology users were significantly younger than the non-users. The majority of patients own a mobile phone (86%) and a computer (67%). Furthermore, 61% of patients used mobile applications, with Facebook and WhatsApp being the most popular social media platforms (48%). Patients who used digital technology tools had higher PSP scores. Furthermore, patients who used digital technology tools had significantly lower scores in PANSS negative subscale. There was no difference in PANSS positive subscale scores between digital technology tool users and non-users. Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia may benefit from mobile applications and social media tools that can help them participate in daily activities and improve their overall well-being.",

The current study assessed the association between obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and telomere length. The LIPIDOGRAM&LIPIDOGEN2015 study was conducted in primary care in 2015-2016. Patients recruited to the LIPIDOGEN2015 cohort (<i>n</i> = 1788) were a random subset of patients of the LIPIDOGRAM2015 (<i>n</i> = 13,724) study. For the aims of this analysis, the recruited patients were divided into four groups based on the presence of MetS: healthy slim (HS), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), non-obese with MetS (NOMS), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). 1516 patients (85% of the total group; 59.7% female, mean age 50.3 years) were included in the final analyses. Increases in body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and history of myocardial infarction moving from HS to MUO were observed. The MUO group exhibited the highest triglyceride and lowest high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) levels. In the univariate regression analyses, NOMS (<i>p</i> = 0.038) and MUO (<i>p</i> = 0.003) were associated with significantly decreased RTL. After adjusting for age, gender, education, smoking, place of residence, and myocardial infarction, the association was no longer statistically significant. Despite the lack of statistical significance in the multivariate analysis, the univariate results suggest that both MUO and NOMS phenotypes contribute to the shortening of telomere length. These results may also indicate that MetS, irrespectively of obesity occurrence, is responsible for the shortened lifespan.",

    "abstract": "The structure of the low redshift Universe is dominated by a multiscale void distribution delineated by filaments and walls of galaxies. The characteristics of voids, such as morphology, average density profile, and correlation function, can be used as cosmological probes. However, their physical properties are difficult to infer due to shot noise and the general lack of tracer particles used to define them. In this work, we construct a robust, topology-based void-finding algorithm that utilizes Persistent Homology to detect persistent features in the data. We apply this approach to a volume-limited subsample of galaxies in the SDSS I/II Main Galaxy catalog with the <i>r</i>-band absolute magnitude brighter than <i>M</i> <sub><i>r</i></sub> = -20.19, and a set of mock catalogs constructed using the Horizon Run 4 cosmological <i>N</i>-body simulation. We measure the size distribution of voids, their averaged radial profile, sphericity, and the centroid nearest neighbor separation, using conservative values for the threshold and persistence. We find 32 topologically robust voids in the SDSS data over the redshift range 0.02 ≤ <i>z</i> ≤ 0.116, with effective radii in the range 21-56 <i>h</i> <sup>-1</sup> Mpc. The median nearest neighbor void separation is found to be ∼57 <i>h</i> <sup>-1</sup> Mpc, and the median radial void profile is consistent with the expected shape from the mock data.",

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who turned 66 years old between 2010 and 2019 at two large health care systems located in Dallas, Texas, and Boston, Massachusetts, from the METRICS (MultilEvel opTimization of the ceRvIcal Cancer Screening process in diverse Settings & populations) Research Center, part of the PROSPR II (Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process) consortium. The primary outcomes were 1) the percentage of patients who were eligible for screening exit at age 66 years after adequate documented negative screening history (at least three consecutive negative cytology test results or two consecutive negative human papillomavirus [HPV] test or co-test results [cytology+HPV testing] within the prior 10 years) and 2) the worst pathology or cytology outcome documented in the cohort after age 65 years. Among 42,393 people who turned 66 years old while in the METRICS cohort, approximately 75.7% (n=32,094) were not eligible to exit screening at age 66 years, primarily because too few screening tests were documented (n=29,354, 91.5% of those ineligible). Furthermore, only 4,037 patients at both sites had 10 years of prior observation within the health care system, meaning data from current and prior health care delivery sites would be needed to assess exit eligibility for more than 90% of the cohort. Patients remained in the cohort after their 66th birthday on average for 3.8 years (interquartile range 2.0-6.5 years), and most (79.3%) had no subsequent evaluation after their 66<sup>th</sup> birthday. Among those ineligible to exit due to insufficient screening history, 83.7% were not subsequently screened. Of the 16.3% who were screened, 90 (1.9%) were diagnosed with cancer or high-grade precancerous lesions, including 34 (0.7%) who were diagnosed with cervical cancer. By contrast, among patients eligible to exit with sufficient screening history, 34.3% had at least one subsequent cytology or pathology result or both, and high-grade precancerous lesions or cervical cancer were diagnosed in only 0.6% (n=16). Data documented in the medical record are often insufficient to meet guidelines for exiting cervical cancer screening.",

    "title": "Decoding 5G security: toward a hybrid threat ontology.",
    "abstract": "This Open Letter announces a new initiative, designed from the ground up, incorporating key cybersecurity standards while providing a novel framework for modelling hybrid threats in 5G infrastructure. The 5G Hybrid Threat Ontology is a structured framework designed to reduce risk and achieve sustainable resilience against hybrid threats targeting 5G infrastructure. As fifth-generation (5G) networks become integral to critical infrastructure, they introduce new vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit through hybrid threats-multifaceted attacks spanning cyber, physical, and socio-political domains. Existing security approaches focus on specific technical vulnerabilities or predictive threat modelling but lack a unified framework to address hybrid threat scenarios systematically. This paper advances the study of 5G security by proposing an ontology-driven approach prioritising resilience through risk reduction rather than threat elimination or prediction. Developed using Semantic Web technologies, specifically the Resource Description Framework (RDF) in Turtle representation for structured threat modelling, the ontology ensures machine-readability, structured threat intelligence sharing, and validation through Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). It integrates established frameworks, including the 5G Threat Taxonomy compiled by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) standard, and other widely used cybersecurity standards. By formalising relationships between adversarial tactics, 5G vulnerabilities, and cascading risks, the ontology enables semantic reasoning using tools within the Protégé framework. Although still under development, the 5G Hybrid Threat Ontology demonstrates strong Description Logic (DL) expressivity, ensuring adaptability for evolving security challenges. This approach bridges high-level policy directives with operational cybersecurity needs, reinforcing a resilience-driven security posture. Future research will build on the phased development of the 5G Hybrid Threat Ontology to enhance adaptive threat modelling and dynamic risk assessment, ensuring that the ontology continues to evolve as a strategic tool for strengthening the resilience of 5G infrastructures against hybrid threats.",

    "title": "Infants Sucking Pattern Identification Using Machine-Learned Computational Modeling.",
    "abstract": "Breastfeeding involves a complex coordination of swallowing, breathing, and sucking, with the infant's sucking proficiency being crucial for adequate nutrient intake. However, real-time assessment of milk intake is difficult, and issues with sucking often become apparent after the infant shows signs of nutrient deficiency. Traditional assessments by clinicians rely on the expertise and subjective judgment of healthcare professionals, enabling personalized evaluations. In this research, we introduce a novel approach to identifying sucking patterns by leveraging data collected from infants during breastfeeding sessions. This method utilizes artificial nipple-based sensors to capture the tongue forces exerted by infants, generating valuable clinical data. In the analysis of the collected time-series data, we applied machine-learned computational modeling (MLCM) algorithms to extract pertinent features and identify distinctive sucking patterns. The best-performing model demonstrated an accuracy of 90%, an 80% recall score, a perfect 100% precision score, a 0.90 f1-score, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80. The proposed classification system has the potential to serve as a reliable decision-support tool for clinicians, offering valuable insights into infants' sucking behaviors. By integrating machine learning (ML)-based computational modeling into clinical practice, we aim to enhance the early identification of unhealthy sucking patterns, allowing for timely interventions and pro-active healthcare management.",

    "abstract": "Studies in beta thalassaemia major (β-TM) patients have shown that the responses of HIF2α, hepcidin, and ferroportin molecules to high iron levels are impaired. In recent years, studies conducted in patients with iron deficiency anaemia have investigated the relationship between ghrelin hormone and iron metabolism. In this study, we aimed to contribute to the aetiopathogenesis of this disease by examining the changes in ghrelin hormone levels in patients with β-TM. Fifty-two β-TM and 23 controls were included in our study. Blood counts, routine biochemical parameters, HIF2α, hepcidin, and ghrelin levels were studied in blood samples taken from the volunteers. Erythrocyte indexes, serum bilirubin, iron, unsaturated iron binding capacity, total iron binding capacity, and ferritin levels showed significant differences between the 2 groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). There was no significant difference between 2 groups for serum HIF2α and hepcidin levels. When the 2 groups were compared, ghrelin levels were found to be significantly higher in the patients (<i>p</i> < 0.05). When the correlation between parameters was examined in all subjects, a weak positive correlation was found between ghrelin and HIF2α (<i>r</i> = 0.263) (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and a significant positive correlation was found between ghrelin and ferritin (<i>r</i> = 0.417) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Our study showed that there is a positive correlation between ghrelin and ferritin levels. Elevated ghrelin levels in patients with β-TM may play an important role in regulating impaired iron metabolism. Molecular level studies are needed to determine synthesis pathways.",

    "abstract": "Research indicates that microbe activity within the human body significantly influences health by being closely linked to various diseases. Accurately predicting microbe-disease interactions (MDIs) offers critical insights for disease intervention and pharmaceutical research. Current advanced AI-based technologies automatically generate robust representations of microbes and diseases, enabling effective MDI predictions. However, these models continue to face significant challenges. A major issue is their reliance on complex feature extractors and classifiers, which substantially diminishes the models' generalizability. To address this, we introduce a novel graph autoencoder framework that utilizes decoupled representation learning and multi-scale information fusion strategies to efficiently infer potential MDIs. Initially, we randomly mask portions of the input microbe-disease graph based on Bernoulli distribution to boost self-supervised training and minimize noise-related performance degradation. Secondly, we employ decoupled representation learning technology, compelling the graph neural network (GNN) to independently learn the weights for each feature subspace, thus enhancing its expressive power. Finally, we implement multi-scale information fusion technology to amalgamate the multi-layer outputs of GNN, reducing information loss due to occlusion. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our model significantly surpasses existing top MDI prediction models. This indicates that our model can accurately predict unknown MDIs and is likely to aid in disease discovery and precision pharmaceutical research.

    "abstract": "To study was to study the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma injections (PRPi) in the treatment of dry eyes. This prospective, interventional study was conducted at a tertiary eye care center, India. One hundred and sixty eyes of 80 patients with newly diagnosed dry eyes were included. One eye received PRPi (cases = 80 eyes), and the other eye of the patient received a lubricating drop (control = 80 eyes). Cases who did not improve at 1-month follow-up (FU) were reinjected with PRP. The outcomes were measured on the basis of ocular surface disease index (OSDI), Schirmer's test (ST), noninvasive tear breakup time (NIBUT), tear meniscus height (TMH), and ocular surface staining (OSS) score done at baseline and 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, and 6-month FU. Sixty cases showed a significant improvement in all the outcome measures at 1 month (<i>P</i> < 0.001), when compared to controls; whereas, 20 cases had to undergo repeat injections. On FU at 2 months, 16 cases (out of those 20 cases) showed a significant improvement (<i>P</i> < 0.05), while 4 cases still did not improve clinically at 3 months. All the outcome parameters (ST, NIBUT, TMH, and OSS and OSDI scores) maintained a significant improvement at 6-month FU, including those four cases (<i>P</i> < 0.001). All the patients were highly satisfied with the intervention. PRPi, as a monotherapy given on <i>pro-re-nata</i> basis, is a simple and efficacious modality of treatment in dry eyes, verified by improvement in subjective and objective tear film parameters.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate ophthalmologists' attitudes and approaches to learning new surgical techniques. This cross-sectional, prospective study distributed an anonymous, voluntary web-based survey via email to surgeons of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO). The survey collected data on demographics, fellowship training, practice location, the number of trainee surgeons supervised, the impact of Coronavirus disease 2019, resources for surgical learning, and perceived barriers to learning and adopting new techniques. Multiple-choice, scaled response, and open-ended questions were used in the survey. Seventy-five surveys were completed (7.1% of 1050 members). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the number of new surgical techniques adopted over the preceding 5 years was associated with the number of trainee surgeons supervised (<i>P</i> = 0.003); membership of the New Zealand branch of RANZCO (<i>P</i> = 0.021); self-reported interest in innovation (<i>P</i> = 0.043); and inversely associated with the age of the surgeon (<i>P</i> = 0.002). YouTube was the most frequently used resource. It was used by 96% of respondents and rated the most useful resource by 95.8% of respondents. The two most frequent barriers to learning and adopting new surgical techniques were fear of adverse outcomes (90.7%) and having an existing technique with good outcomes (90.7%). This is the first study exploring how ophthalmologists learn new surgical techniques. The widespread use of YouTube for surgical learning highlights the opportunity for postgraduate colleges to create or post quality-controlled online video resources for their members.",

    "abstract": "The 2014 Israeli war on the Gaza Strip was described, as the 'longest' and 'most violent', compared to previous wars since 2008. This paper reports on this war experiences for educationalists (academic staff and students) at two of Gaza's universities. It draws on 36 in-depth semi-structured interviews with educationalists in the Gaza Strip, which I conducted via Skype and mobile/phones from the UK, for my PhD research at the University of Cambridge. Theoretically, the inductive study uses insights from Freire's <i>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i> and Bourdieu's work on symbolic violence, retrospectively. Findings from this research show the impact of the war on Gaza's educationalists has varied between vulnerability and resilience. The memories of loss, fear, and dehumanization continued to affect educationalists, even after the war came to halt. Some of Gaza's universities buildings, and facilities were also damaged. Consequently, Gaza's universities found themselves in a dilemma on how to manage immediate needs, with developmental prospects. This paper documents the history of Gaza's universities, enhancing our sociological understanding of the experiences of higher education in the Gaza Strip, and the challenges for its development. The research widens the geographical scope of research on conflict, and education, by including the experiences of educationalists in the occupied and besieged context of Gaza, which is significantly under-researched. Insights from this research could be useful to inform the process of reconstruction of higher education in the Gaza Strip, after Israel's ongoing war on the Gaza Strip, since 7th October 2023 comes to end.",

    "title": "Best Approach for Incomplete Colonoscopy: Colon Capsule Endoscopy or Repeat Conventional Colonoscopy?",
    "abstract": "The most appropriate strategy for completing a previous incomplete colonoscopy (IC) is not standardized. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of two strategies for completing a previous IC: colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) versus repeat conventional colonoscopy. A retrospective cohort study that included consecutive adult patients referred to our center after IC under sedation due to irreducible loop formation or colonic fixed angulation was performed. Patients underwent CCE (PillCam COLON2 Medtronic<sup>®</sup>) or repetition of conventional colonoscopy under sedation. In this setting, an appropriate CCE progression was defined as the capsule reaching the segment achieved during the previous IC. Repeated conventional colonoscopy was considered complete when cecal intubation was accomplished. We compared the rate of appropriate CCE colon progression with the cecal intubation rate from repeated conventional colonoscopy. Quality of colon preparation, diagnostic yield, and rate of adverse events for CCE and colonoscopy was also analyzed. A total of 192 CCE and 181 colonoscopies were performed for IC, primarily due to fixed angulation of the left colon (69.2%, <i>n</i> = 258). There were no significant differences between the two groups (CCE vs. colonoscopy) concerning age, sex, overweight/obesity status, previous abdominal surgery, and reasons for IC. The rate of appropriate colon progression with CCE was not significantly different from the cecal intubation rate of repeated colonoscopy (95.3% vs. 90.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.073, respectively), even after adjusting for the quality of colon preparation (<i>p</i> = 0.122), which differed significantly between the groups (76.0% vs. 92.8%, <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in overall colorectal findings identified between the CCE and colonoscopy groups (55.2% vs. 62.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.172, respectively), and no adverse events were reported in either group. Our findings suggest that both CCE and repeat conventional colonoscopy are effective and safe options for completing a previous IC.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have indicated that immune cells play a significant role in the occurrence and development of membranous nephropathy (MN). However, the causal relationship between the two has not been fully established. To further investigate this, we employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study design. Genetic instrumental variables for immune cells were sourced from an extensive genome-wide association study (GWAS). MN summary statistics, involving 2,150 cases and 5,829 controls, were obtained from a separate GWAS. The primary analysis employed the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. To explore reverse causation, a reverse MR analysis was undertaken. Rigorous sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure the resilience and reliability of the study's findings. We identified eight immunophenotypes associated with a reduced risk of MN, and all of them were protective factors for MN. The sensitivity analyses consistently yielded similar results for these immune traits. In the reverse MR analysis, we did not observe any statistically significant associations between MN and these eight immunophenotypes. Our study, utilizing genetic approaches, provides evidence for a causal relationship between immune cells and MN, which has implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Further comprehensive investigations are needed to explore the detailed mechanisms underlying the impact of immune cells on MN.",

The convenience sampling method was preferred for this methodological study, in which 411 clinical and non-clinical individuals were included. The clinical group included 41 patients with major depressive disorders attending the psychiatric outpatient ward. The study's data were collected with the Descriptive Information Form, short-form 6-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Beck Depression Inventory, and Trait Anxiety (A-Trait) Scale. The Cronbach's alpha value of the UCLA Loneliness Scale-6 Item Short Form was calculated as 0.884, and the scale's internal consistency level was quite high. For the UCLA Loneliness Scale-6 Item Short Form, the variability level of the items constituting the one-dimensional structure produced from the explanatory factor analysis was 63.411%, and it could distinguish patients with descriptive features and clinical diagnosis (p<0.05). The scores of the UCLA Loneliness Scale-6 Item Short Form and other scales assessing loneliness showed a significant correlation (r=-0.476 - 0.618). The short-form 6-item UCLA Loneliness Scale is a simple, easy-to-apply, reliable, and valid scale that can be used in studies assessing loneliness.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to examine the relationship between university students' difficulties regulating emotions and their tendency to gamble. The population of this cross-sectional and correlational study consisted of 69,000 undergraduate level students studying at three state universities in three different provinces in Turkey between February-September 2022. Based on the calculation using the sampling method of the known population, study data were collected face-to-face from 750 students. The data were collected using three tools: a descriptive information form, the South Oaks Gambling Screening Test (SOGS), and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Brief Form (DERS-16). Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and Multiple Linear Regression analysis were used to analyze the relationship among the scales' mean scores. Of the participating university students, 51.6% were female and 48.4% were male. Of these students, 42% stated that they had gambled at least once in their lives and 25.3% of them were still gambling. The mean DERS score was 38.14±14.37, which indicated a moderate difficulty in emotional regulation, and the mean SOGS score was 5.12±3.18. A positive and significant correlation was found between DERS SOGS (r=0.304, p<0.05). It was determined that university students' tendency to gamble was predicted by the three sub-dimensions of the DERS (Clarity (β=0.258, p=0.001), Purpose (β=0.156, p=0.021) and Non-Acceptance (β=1.768, p=0.001)), being male and gambling status in the family (p<0.05).

    "abstract": "The design and practice of ethics in a profession can shape how it develops over time, setting the field apart from others. Professional training in ethics, however, is challenging. Application within the classroom is nearly entirely hypothetical, in comparison to more direct and precision-driven concepts and skills in the field such as data collection, schedules of reinforcement, assessment, and treatment procedures. This tutorial provides considerations for teaching the creation and use of decision trees in three parts (1) recommendations based on an interdisciplinary review of literature, (2) recommendations based on the results of a pilot study conducted by the authors, and (3) recommendations based on the authors' pedagogical experiences in behavior analytic graduate course sequences.",

    "abstract": "The current evidence indicates that inflammation is highly related to depression but not to anxiety in clinical samples. However, less understood is the relationship between inflammation and symptoms of depression and anxiety in a nonclinical sample. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between three inflammation markers and symptoms of depression and anxiety in a healthy sample without a history of psychiatric disorders. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated in 74 healthy adults (mean age=42.3; SD=11.8) using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We assessed proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and CRP), and morning cortisol levels using blood samples. TNF-α correlates positively with depressive symptoms, but there were no significant relationships between anxiety scores and inflammation markers. Importantly, TNF-α relates to symptoms of depression independently of anxiety scores, age, body mass index, cortisol, and sex. Our results indicate that TNF-α is associated with depressive symptoms, independently of anxiety, age, body mass index, cortisol, and sex, even in a sample of hospital health professionals without diagnosis or psychiatric history.",

    "abstract": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is an idiosyncratic and potentially life-threatening drug reaction. Although uncommon, NMS cases induced by oral quetiapine have been reported. Most reports have predisposing risk factors such as an organic brain disorder, concomitant use of other antipsychotics or lithium, overdose or rapid titration. NMS with low doses of quetiapine is a much rarer clinical picture. Venlafaxine is commonly associated with withdrawal upon discontinuation sometimes as soon as the next day. In this case report, a 40-year-old man treated with venlafaxine for generalized anxiety disorder with symptoms of full-blown NMS after venlafaxine withdrawal, induced by low-dose quetiapine (50 mg), is presented. In accordance with the previous reports, we speculate that venlafaxine withdrawal was a predisposing factor in our case however we also discussed other possible risk factors for NMS. Acknowledging the risk of NMS, even with low doses of quetiapine in patients devoid of known risk factors, is of paramount importance for prompt diagnosis and mitigating morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, this is the first case of NMS with such a low dose of quetiapine without any other known risk factors or substances.",

    "abstract": "Later life is often seen as a time of losses. Through the death of loved ones and the dwindling of bodily capacities, older people are increasingly confronted with their own mortality. As losses accrue across different domains, they form a unique existential vantage point. We aim to shed light on this understudied dimension of later life by analysing older people's everyday practices of sense-making. Drawing on the findings of a qualitative interview study (<i>n</i>=16, aged 65-93), we identify three distinct practices by which older people make sense of death and bereavement: timing, communing, and missing. We conceptualise these practices as \"farewell ceremonies,\" a term we borrow from Simone de Beauvoir. The \"farewell ceremony\" describes a period of incremental goodbyes, which characterised the last ten years of Jean-Paul Sartre as well as the death process of Beauvoir's mother Françoise. Beauvoir captures these farewell ceremonies in her memoirs <i>Adieux: A Farewell to Sartre</i> and <i>A Very Easy Death</i>, which frame our philosophical reflection on practices of timing, communing, and missing. Bringing together Beauvoir's literary and philosophical work with our empirical findings, we propose an integrated view on death and bereavement in later life that centres the intertwining perspectives of self and other.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour in infants and children, accounting for approximately 15% of paediatric cancer mortality. These tumours are unique in that a subset, namely stage MS, frequently undergo spontaneous regression or differentiation. Differentiation therapy, where cancer cells are re-routed back down their correct developmental pathway, is therefore a promising therapeutic avenue. We have previously shown that the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib induces both decreased proliferation and enhanced neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells <i>in vitro</i>. When combined with retinoic acid, already used clinically for maintenance therapy, this differentiation is enhanced. Here, we investigate two additional CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib and ribociclib, to induce differentiation of the relapsed, high-risk MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2)C, with and without retinoic acid. We culture SK-N-BE(2)C cells in both adherent and three-dimensional culture and monitor proliferation and differentiation using readouts including live-imaging, immunocytochemistry, qRT-PCR and EdU incorporation. We find the CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib all enhance retinoic acid-induced differentiation in both adherent SK-N-BE(2)C cells and 3D spheroids. CDK4/6 inhibitors display a class effect in inducing neuronal differentiation together with retinoic acid, both in adherent neuroblastoma cell lines and three-dimensional tumour spheroids. This is an important consideration for potentially developing CDK inhibitor-induced differentiation as a therapy in the clinic.",

There is no structured data on prevalence of various sleep behaviours and sleep related disorders in children in India. We aim to study sleep behaviour of children to know the common paediatric sleep related disorders. We enrolled 270 children between the age of 1 to 18 years visiting pediatric OPDs for minor ailments between June 2022 to June 2023 using Children Sleep habit questionnaire - (NICHD SECCYD, Wisconsin). Children having clinical features suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea were further subjected to overnight level 1 Polysomnography study. Most children had bed time consistency with average sleep duration of Mean ± 2SD (8.58 ± 1.35 h, N=270), which was shorter than global average. Allergic disorders were significantly high with prevalence of allergic rhinitis up to 30 % and asthma between 8-10 % in our study. Prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea on Polysomnography study was 5.6%, parent reported snoring 10 %, restless leg movements 30% and open mouth breathing in 35% Indian children. In our study, Asthma had statistically significant association with sleep disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea with p value < 0.01. Asthma has statistically significant association with obstructive sleep apnoea in our study. Proper asthma treatment may reduce the burden of obstructive sleep apnoea in children. There is a growing need to screen children regularly for sleep related issues on routine visits.",

Studies have shown that the prevalence of both numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities is increased in such men. A few genes have been implicated in sex development during gonadal and functional differentiation, where the maintenance of the somatic sex as either male or female is achieved by the suppression of the alternate route. One such entity in the vast group of male infertility etiologies is the de la Chapelle syndrome or 46, XX testicular disorder of sex differentiation (DSD), which is a rare disorder characterized by discordance between the male phenotype and the female karyotype. This syndrome's exact molecular and genetic basis is yet to be described in full potential. Due to the rare diagnosis of such cases, we report this case of infertile male diagnosed as SRY-positive 46, XX testicular DSD, aiming to add to the previously reported cases in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Current management of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) based on dysplasia grading is controversial. The malignant transformation rate of OPMDs does not correlate well with dysplasia grading, resulting in non-standardized treatment for patients. A quantitative biomarker-based risk score (qBRS; trade name StraticyteTM) was previously developed to address shortcomings related to the current standard of care. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study consisting of biopsied OPMDs was used to validate qBRS for predicting transformation of OPMDs to OSCC. Three hundred and two cases were immunostained, imaged, and analyzed via qBRS. A binary prognostic risk was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve optimizing sensitivity and specificity. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the cumulative probability of lack of malignant transformation for patients with elevated or normal biomarker-based risk. The results demonstrated very high sensitivity (96.2%) and negative predictive value (96.2%) for qBRS. Elevated risk scores had higher predicted probabilities of transformation to cancer, independent of dysplasia grade. qBRS can be a useful clinical adjunct tool to dysplasia grading for the assessment of malignant transformation potential, providing a quantitative metric in OPMDs. The addition of qBRS to current histological techniques should improve early detection rates of OSCC, enhancing the effectiveness of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cost-effective, practical, and reproducible culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is required for basic and translational research. Basal 8 (B8) has emerged as a cost-effective solution for weekend-free and chemically-defined hPSC culture. However, the requirement to home-produce some recombinant growth factors for B8 can hinder access and reproducibility. Moreover, we found the published B8 formulation suboptimal in widely-used normoxic hPSC culture. Lastly, the performance of B8 in functional applications such as genome editing or organoid differentiation required systematic evaluation. We formulated B8 with commercially available, growth factors and adjusted its composition to support normoxic culture of WTC11 human induced pluripotent stem cell line. We compared this formulation (B8+) with commercial Essential 8 (cE8) and a home-made, weekend-free E8 formulation (hE8). We measured pluripotency marker expression and cell cycle by flow cytometry, and investigated the transcriptional profiles by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. We further assessed genomic stability, genome editing efficiency, single-cell cloning, and differentiation in both monolayer and organoids. Finally, we validated key findings using male (H1) and female (H9) human embryonic stem cells. hE8 performed comparably to cE8 across most functional assays and cell lines. In contrast, cells in B8+ displayed higher NANOG expression and improved genome editing efficiency. At the same time, B8+ led to gene expression changes indicative of marked lineage priming, reflected in altered morphology and differential response to some differentiation protocols. Both weekend-free media resulted in a modest transcriptional shift towards a less metabolically active state, consistent with intermittent media starvation. Homemade weekend-free media can provide a cost-effective alternative to commercial formulations. hE8, integrating some features of B8 while resembling cE8, emerges as a robust and practical option with limited compromises. B8+, though advantageous in some contexts, warrants caution due to lineage priming effects that may impact differentiation outcomes.",

According to models of community-engaged research, involving TGD community members in establishing research priorities can improve the relevance and impact of research for this population. The purpose of this study was to clarify community priorities for research relevant to TGD populations. Forty-five individuals participated across five asynchronous online focus groups. Participants discussed topics chosen in collaboration with a community research advisory board, including gender-affirming hormone therapy. Rapid qualitative analysis was used to identify salient themes. Research priorities voiced across all represented gender identities were: (1) Longitudinal, prospective research on long-term effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy, (2) Standardized training for providers and researchers, (3) Implementation research on methods to educate the public and reduce discrimination, and (4) Basic research on the biological, historical, and social underpinnings of gender identity. This study provides insight into clinical priorities for TGD populations. Findings highlight a need for basic science research to better understand the underpinnings of gender identity, longitudinal studies to investigate long-term effects of hormone therapy, and education for the public on gender diversity to combat discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Radiomics involves the extraction and analysis of numerous quantitative features of medical imaging which can add more information from radiological images often beyond initial comprehension of a clinician. Unlike deep learning, radiomics allows some understanding of identified quantitative features for clinical prediction. We sought to explore the current state of radiomics applications in the skull base literature. A systematic review of studies evaluating radiomics in skull base was performed, including those with and without machine-learning approaches. Studies were summarized into thematic elements as well as specific pathologies. A total of 102 studies with 26,280 radiographic images were included. The earliest radiomic study was published in 2017 with exponential growth in research since then. Most studies focused on tumor diagnosis (40.8%), followed by tumor prognosis (31.1%), automated segmentation (16.5%), other applications (7.8%), and lastly prediction of intraoperative features (3.9%). Pituitary adenomas (41.7%) and vestibular schwannomas (18.4%) represented the most commonly evaluated pathologies; however, radiomics could be applied to a heterogeneous collection of skull base pathologies. The average study included 258 ± 677 cases (range 4; 6,755). Radiomics offers many functions in treating skull base pathology and will likely be an essential component of future clinical care. Larger sample sizes, validation of predictive models, and clinical application are needed. Further investigation into the strengths and weaknesses of radiomic applications in skull base treatments is warranted.",

    "title": "Identifying clinical feature clusters toward predicting stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.",
    "abstract": "Despite the widespread application of machine learning models and feature selection methods to identify important clinical features in electronic health records (EHR) for disease prediction, the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to uncover significant clinical features associated with a disease remains largely unexplored. In this investigation, we developed a computational method utilizing EHR data from Indiana University Medical Hospital to predict stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. We first constructed a patient clinical feature graph for each patient based on the co-occurrence of features (medications, diagnoses, and results of laboratory tests) in the EHR data within a predefined timeframe (e.g., 6 months before the detection of the disease). Then, we applied an unsupervised GNN-based clustering approach and our algorithm to select notable clinical feature clusters crucial for stroke prediction. These clinical features served as the basis for constructing patient representation for prediction. Various supervised learning models were evaluated for their prediction capabilities. Unlike conventional feature selection methods, our GNN-based feature selection approach relies solely on positive cases. We compared our method against baseline models for stroke prediction and achieved robust performance metrics, including an AUC of 0.87 and an F1 score of 0.80, surpassing all baselines. Additionally, we conducted an ablation study on the amount of EHR data, measured in months, to determine the most effective approach for generating patient clinical feature graphs. By capturing inherent relationships between clinical features using the graph model, our approach offers a promising avenue for advancing disease prediction, particularly in scenarios with limited positive cases available. Our code can be found on Github (https://github.com/xudav001/Identifying-Phenotype-Clusters).",

    "title": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms in siblings of children with Tourette syndrome in the EMTICS study.",
    "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is associated with neuropsychiatric comorbidities, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Even though comorbidities are the main source of impairment in individuals with TS, family aggregation between TS and other neuropsychiatric disorders has been little explored. We therefore investigated associations of tic severity in probands with symptoms of ASD, ADHD, and ODD in their siblings and the influence of tic severity, age, and sex. The sample of the present study stems from the European Multicenter Tics in Children Study (EMTICS), a longitudinal observational study, with the present subsample of 196 probands with TS and their 220 full siblings (54.1% girls). We analyzed associations of probands' tic severity with ASD, ADHD, and ODD symptoms in their siblings using generalized linear mixed-effect negative binomial regression models. Higher tic severity in probands was associated with higher scores of ASD symptoms in their siblings (IRR = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.03-2.12, <i>p</i> = 0.034); after excluding the three items in the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire linked to stereotypies (that may be misinterpreted as tic-like behaviors; IRR = 1.44 [95% CI] 0.99-2.09, <i>p</i> = 0.057) the effect size remained similar, yet reaching only near-significance. Moreover, we demonstrated a significant interaction between probands' tic severity and sex upon siblings' symptoms of ADHD and ODD. Female siblings of probands with higher tic severity displayed more symptoms of ADHD and ODD, whereas this effect was absent in male siblings. This multicenter study demonstrated a link between probands' current tic severity and siblings' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our study suggests a familial link between TS and ASD-like symptoms, competencies as well as sex-specific associations with ADHD and ODD symptoms in female siblings. The current study sheds light on a broader family tendency and highlights the need for targeted prevention in this vulnerable population. Our findings, however, call for further studies to better understand the genetic and environmental aggregation of influences between individuals with TS, ADHD, and ODD and their siblings.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with lower limb amputation have increased risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (KOA) in the intact limb, however there is little information regarding strength profiles in individuals with KOA with and without amputation. To compare lower extremity strength in individuals with KOA with and without unilateral transfemoral (TF) amputation. Descriptive laboratory study. Seven participants with unilateral TF amputation (3F/4M, 58.0 ± 11.0 years, 172.7 ± 12.8 cm, 90.8 ± 19.1 kg, 38.8 ± 14.4 years after amputation) and symptomatic KOA in the intact limb and 9 participants with unilateral KOA (control (CON)) without leg amputation (4F/5M, 66.0 ± 9.9 years, 170.5 ± 10.7 cm, 86.8 ± 18.1 kg) participated in this study. Both groups completed strength testing on the involved limb with KOA and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire to meaure subjective function. Strength variables were mass-normalized. There were no significant differences between groups in age, mass, or height. The CON group reported significantly reduced subjective function on the KOOS total score (P = 0.049; d = 1.03) and KOOS symptoms scores (P = 0.047, d = 0.95) compared with the TF amputation group. A lower subjective function score indicates worse function. There were no other significant differences between groups on KOOS subcategories. The TF amputation group had significantly greater average isokinetic quadriceps torque (P = 0.05; d = 1.10), peak isokinetic quadriceps torque (P = 0.02; d = 1.36), and average isokinetic quadriceps power (P = 0.02; d = 1.38) compared with the CON group. There were no differences between groups in isometric knee extensor strength or any differences in knee flexor isokinetic or isometric strength. The TF amputation group demonstrated greater isokinetic knee extensor strength in their intact limb with KOA compared with the CON group osteoarthritic limb; however, there were no differences in isometric strength. Furthermore, the differences in isokinetic strength may suggest that those with a history of leg amputation may require more strength and power in the intact limb to maintain daily activity and, therefore, may require greater thresholds of strength to protect the knee joint from cartilage degradation.",

    "title": "Types of refractive errors in a sample of Iraqi children with Intermittent exotropia.",
    "abstract": "One of the most common strabismus types in children is intermittent exotropia (IXE), which predominantly occurs in children between the ages of 2-4 years. It may affect visual development and often coexists with refractive errors. Unlike esotropia, which is typically associated with hyperopia, IXE demonstrates a more complex relationship with refractive errors. Recent studies suggest a possible link with myopia; however, this relationship remains unclear. This study will investigate the prevalence and distribution of refractive errors in children with IXE, challenging the traditionally held relationship between strabismus and hyperopia and its possible contribution to the development of myopia. In this cross-sectional retrospective study from August 2021 to December 2023, 179 patients diagnosed with IXE were recruited via an outpatient clinic in Najah Al-Quraishi, Baghdad, Iraq. The refractive errors were compared by autorefractometry and retinoscopy after cycloplegic dilation. Data analysis was conducted under the use of IBM SPSS V.26 for the determination of emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia prevalence. Among the 179 patients, emmetropia was the most commonly observed refractive status, present in 68 patients (38%). Low hyperopia and low myopia were also common, with 64 and 40, respectively. A limited number of patients had moderate/high myopia and moderate/high hyperopia; in detail, the prevalence was as follows: 5% of patients had moderate myopia, while 0.5% of patients suffered from high myopia; symmetrically, 5% were moderate to high hyperopia. From the data collected, a trend emerged for a low refractive error and symmetric refractive error in both eyes. Contrasted to prior conventional wisdom about refractive error in strabismus, it established the greater prevalence of emmetropia in patients with IXE. The findings call for specific management strategies to be applied in this population.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the impact of residential segregation on early detection, treatment, and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a predominant type of lung cancers. Does racialized economic segregation play a role in NSCLC treatment and outcomes and contribute to racial disparities? This study included non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients with NSCLC diagnosed between 2007 and 2015 and identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset. County-level racialized economic segregation was estimated using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE). Multilevel logistic regression and multilevel Cox regression accounting for county-level clustering were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for late-stage diagnosis and treatment underutilization, and hazard ratio (HR) for mortality. Of 203,441 patients, 85.8% were NHW and 14.2% were NHB. Compared with patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of high-income NHW households (lowest ICE quintile), patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of low-income NHB households (highest ICE quintile) had higher risks of late-stage diagnosis (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> <.001), underutilization of guideline-recommended treatment (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.16-1.41; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> <.0001), lung cancer-specific mortality (HR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.07-1.14; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> <.0001), and overall mortality (HR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.09-1.16; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> <.0001). The association between segregation and treatment underutilization was stronger in NHW than NHB patients (P<sub>interaction</sub> =0.02). There was no significant difference in the segregation-related risk of late-stage diagnosis, lung cancer-specific mortality, or overall mortality between NHW and NHB patients. Living in segregated, low-income NHB counties had adverse impacts on early detection, treatment, and outcomes of NSCLC. However, residential segregation did not explain the excess risks of NSCLC care underutilization and mortality in NHB patients compared with NHW patients.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of platelet transfusions in the presence of thrombocytopenia in late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) caused by gram-negative bacteria in preterm neonates. Methods: The newborns, who received platelet transfusions, were divided into two groups: those with bleeding and those without bleeding. Results: The median gestational age and birth weight of the newborns were 29 (26-31) w and 1100 (865-1470) g, respectively. Of the 72 neonates, 50 (69.5%) did not bleed and 22 (30.5%) bled. The time for the platelet count to exceed 50,000/µL was similar between the groups: 5 (3-10) days in the bleeding group and 4 (3-7) days in the non-bleeding group, and the median number of transfusions was two in both groups. In the transfused group, the mortality rate in patients with bleeding was significantly higher compared to those without bleeding (27.3% vs. 8%, <i>p</i> = 0.0001). Conclusion: Although platelet transfusion was performed in the presence of severe thrombocytopenia in gram-negative LONS, the platelet counts exceeded 50,000/µL not immediately after transfusion, but in approximately four days, and repeated platelet transfusions were generally required. The mortality rate was higher in those who bled compared to those who did not bleed. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12288-024-01916-6.",

    "abstract": "The increased clinical application of cell-based therapies has resulted in a parallel increase in the need for non-invasive imaging-based approaches for cell tracking, often through labelling with nanoparticles. An ideal nanoparticle for such applications must be biologically compatible as well as readily internalized by cells to ensure adequate and stable cell loading. Surface coatings have been used to make nanoparticle trackers suitable for these purposes, but those currently employed tend to have cytotoxic effects. Zwitterionic ligands are known to be biocompatible and antifouling, however the head-to-head evaluation of specific zwitterionic ligands for cell loading has not yet been explored. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) detects superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) using time varying magnetic fields. Because MPI can produce high contrast, real-time images with no tissue depth limitation, it is an ideal candidate for <i>in vivo</i> cell tracking. In this work, we have conjugated hard (permanently charged) and soft (pKa-dependently charged) biomimetic zwitterionic ligands to SPIONs and characterized how these ligands changed SPION physicochemical properties. We have evaluated cellular uptake and subcellular localization between zwitterions, how the improvement in cell uptake generated stronger MPI signal for smaller numbers of cells, and how these cells can be tracked in an animal model with greater sensitivity for longer periods of time. Our best-performing surface coating afforded high cell loading within 4 hr, with full signal retention <i>in vivo</i> over 7 days.",

    "abstract": "Biomarker enrichment clinical trial designs are versatile tools to assess the treatment effect and increase the efficiency of clinical trials. In this paper, we propose a two-stage enrichment clinical trial design with survival outcomes, and consider the situation where the biomarker assay and classification are possibly subject to errors. Specifically, the first stage is a randomized design, stratified by the biomarker appeared status. Depending on the result of the interim analysis and a pre-specified futility criterion, the second stage can be either enriched with only the biomarker appeared positive patients, or remain as the stratified design with both biomarker appeared positive and biomarker appeared negative patients. Compared to continuous and binary outcomes, test statistics to account for biomarker misclassification are much more complicated and require special care. We develop log-rank statistics for the interim and final analyses, with an adjustment for the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker assay. Control of Type I error rate is achieved by considering correlations between adjusted log-rank statistics from the same and/or different stages. R code is developed to calculate critical values, global/marginal power, and sample size. Our method is illustrated with examples of a recently successful development of immunotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.",

In this retrospective observational study from 2016-2023, the medical records of 580 DLBCL patients were analysed. The cell of origin was based on immunohistochemistry using the Hans algorithm. The median age of presentation was 55 years, with the Activated B-cell (ABC) type being the most common. Stage IV disease was observed in 41% of the patients. As per International Prognostic Index (IPI) risk stratification, 38% and 36% of the patients were in the low intermediate (LI) and high intermediate (HI) risk groups, respectively. Extranodal involvement, B symptoms, and bulky disease were seen in 26%, 46%, and 29% of the patients, respectively. R-CHOP chemotherapy was used in 75% of the patients.

This study explores the mechanism of AFIF against antibiotics-induced constipation (AC) in mice. Forty six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (<i>n</i> = 10): control, control + AFIF, model, and model + AFIF groups. The AC model was established by antibiotics mixture for 8 days. Mice were gavaged daily with AFIF (0.1 mL/10 g, 3 g/mL) for 2 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were used for histological analysis. The colonic microbiota was analyzed by 16sRNA sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing was used to detect miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. The results showed that AFIF treatment improved constipation in AC mice: increased fecal number, fecal wet weight, fecal water content, and intestinal propulsion rate; decreased average weight of individual feces. AFIF improved the colonic pathological injury and increased acetylcholine (ACH), gastrin (GAS), motilin (MTL), substance P (SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels. Moreover, AFIF might improve AC by regulating colonic microbiota and a \"miRNA-mRNA\" regulatory network related to cell junction and neuroactive function. This study also found the colonic microbiota at the genus level was connected to the expressions and target mRNA expressions (including Ccdc85b, Dlgap2, Elavl4, and Shisa6) of mmu-miR-5100 and mmu-miR-18b-5p. In conclusions, AFIF could improve AC via regulating colonic microbiota and a \"miRNA-mRNA\" regulatory network, which provide a theoretical basis for expanding its clinical application.",

A total of 201 participants were included in the study, consisting of 66 individuals diagnosed with obesity, 62 diagnosed with OUD and 73 healthy controls. Sociodemographic Data Form and Adult Attachment Style Scale were administered to all participants, the Addiction Profile Index (API) was administered to participants diagnosed with OUD and the Yale Food Addiction Scale was administered to those diagnosed with obesity. The results of the study revealed that the attachment styles of individuals diagnosed with obesity showed a similar distribution to those diagnosed with OUD, and the distribution of attachment styles in both groups was found to be different from that of the healthy control group. The mean scores for ambivalent/anxious attachment style and secure attachment style were found to be similar for the obesity group and the OUD group, while the OUD group had significantly higher avoidant attachment score. The avoidant attachment style score of OUD group increase as the severity of dependency increases. Additionally, 42.4% of the group was found to be food addicted, and in this group, the mean scores for ambivalent/anxious attachment style were found to be significantly higher. In the study, significant similarities were obtained in terms of attachment styles among participants diagnosed with obesity and OUD.

    "abstract": "Microbial communities that promote plant growth show promise in reducing the impacts of climate change on plant health and productivity. Understanding microbe-microbe interactions in a community context is paramount for designing effective microbial consortia that enhance plant resilience. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of a synthetic microbial community (SynCom) assembled from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> leaves to elucidate factors shaping community composition and stability. We found notable disparities between <i>in vitro</i> pairwise interactions and those inferred from correlation networks <i>in planta</i>. Our findings suggested that secondary metabolites, particularly antimicrobials, might mediate interactions <i>in vitro</i>, but are not key drivers of microbial interactions in a community context. Through co-cultivation experiments, we identified the siderophore pseudobactin as a potent antimicrobial agent against several SynCom members, but its impact on community composition <i>in planta</i> was negligible. Notably, dominant SynCom members, such as <i>Pseudomonas koreensis, Flavobacterium pectinovorum</i>, and <i>Sporobolomyces roseus</i>, exhibited only positive correlations, suggesting synergism based on factors such as exopolysaccharides and biotransformation might drive community dynamics rather than competition. Two correlations between SynCom members in the co-abundance network corresponded to their pairwise <i>in vitro</i> interactions, highlighting the potential for further research and demonstrating the usefulness of correlation networks in identifying key microbe-microbe interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of considering microbiome-wide interaction studies and synthetic communities in understanding and manipulating plant microbiomes.",

    "title": "Transorbital Endoscopic Approach for Managing Challenging Frontal Sinus Lesions: Results and Operative Technique Description.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe our experience using the transorbital endoscopic approach (TEA) in the frontal sinus and the step-by-step technique used. We reviewed the charts from adult patients who underwent management of frontal sinus lesions with TEA performed from 2017 to 2022. Seven patients underwent eight surgeries for frontal sinus lesions using TEA in combination with the endoscopic transnasal approach (ETA), with the majority on the left side (5/8, 62.5%). The average age was 53.9 years, with six male patients and one female patient. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in all cases. The most common symptoms leading to surgery were headaches or a sensation of pressure in the forehead (5/8, 62.5%), followed by a decreased sense of smell (3/8, 37.5%), diplopia (3/8, 37.5%), proptosis (2/8, 20%), periorbital cellulitis (2/8, 20%), and decreased visual acuity (1/8, 12.5%). The most common etiology in this case series was mucocele (5/8, 62.5%), followed by osteoid osteoma (2/8, 20%), and inverted papilloma (1/8, 12.5%). The length of stay in all cases was 1 day. The most common complication was mild and transitory V1 numbness, which fully recovered after 6 months (5/8, 62.5%). The average follow-up period was 24.6 months (range of 3-48 months). Transoral Endoscopic Approach (TEA) demonstrated being a valuable complement to ETA approaches for treating frontal sinus lesions, especially in challenging regions. The transorbital approach is feasible and can safely achieve GTR for a variety of pathologies while effectively controlling symptoms and resulting in a 1-day hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Amid changing social dynamics, the world of higher education faces, among other challenges, the growing impact on the mental health of students. In this scenario, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) highlights the important role of autonomy support as it generates positive effects on students' motivation and well-being. The present study tests the predictive capacity of the teacher's interpersonal style of autonomy support in a higher education institution, in relation to the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, autonomous motivation and depressive symptoms. A sample composed of 356 Spanish university students of which 237 were male (66.57%) from different grades and courses, aged between 17 and 57 years ( <i>M</i> = 20.83; <i>SD</i> = 3.44), from middle socioeconomic strata, was used, and selected through purposive sampling. After the analysis of structural equations, the results showed that the teacher's interpersonal style of autonomy support positively predicted: the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, and autonomous motivation; but negatively depressive symptoms. The model describes the possible importance of promoting the teacher's interpersonal style of autonomy support in higher education as a protective factor for well-being and mental health. These findings highlight the importance of motivational strategies that higher education teachers must implement to promote student motivation and well-being.",

    "abstract": "As health systems move to make electronic health records (EHRs) accessible to patients, there is a need to examine if, and the extent to which, bias toward patients may be evident in these records. This scoping review aimed to summarize the scientific literature on methods used to detect biased language about patients in the EHR and the nature and object of the biases detected. A comprehensive literature search was conducted of PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, APA PsycInfo, and SOCIndex for peer-reviewed English language studies conducted in the United States published on or before December 22, 2022. Seven studies were included in this review. Four methods were identified: natural language processing methods including machine learning-based (<i>n</i> = 3), Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (<i>n</i> = 2), and exploratory vocabulary analysis (<i>n</i> = 1), and manual content analysis (<i>n</i> = 2). In four studies, the EHR of Black patients contained significantly greater bias relative to the EHR of White patients. Bias about health conditions (i.e., diabetes, substance use disorder, and chronic pain), women, and preexposure prophylaxis-a medication that prevents HIV infection-were identified. Machine-based learning methods may be best to (a) analyze robust data sampling frames, (b) detect a rare outcome like bias, (c) facilitate inferential analysis, and (d) transcend limitations of manual content analysis. Findings provide an overview of methods that can be used by investigators to analyze EHR records for bias to inform clinical interventions, health policies, and procedures to reduce bias among health care providers.",

The length (ACPL), width (ACPW), and angle (ACPA) of ACP, and the distance (DisACPOS) of ACP to the optic strut (OS) were measured. ACP pneumatization and OS location types were noted. <b>Results</b>  ACPL, ACPW, and ACPA, and DisACPOS were measured as 12.34 ± 2.29 mm, 4.52 ± 1.03 mm, 26.26 ± 4.30°, and 5.10 ± 1.12 mm, respectively. ACP pneumatization was identified in 30 (8.3%) sides. Four types regarding its pneumatization were observed: Type 0 in 91.7% out of 360 sides, Type 1 in 2.5%, Type 2 in 3.6%, and Type 3 in 2.2%. Three configurations regarding OS location types were observed as follows: Type C in 3.6% out of 360 sides, Type D in 51.7%, and Type E in 44.7%. Linear function was calculated as <i>y</i>  = 9.377 + 0.312 × age for ACPL, <i>y</i>  = 3.716 + 0.084 × age for ACPW, and <i>y</i>  = 3.808 + 0.136 × age for DisACPOS. <b>Conclusion</b>  ACPL, ACPW, and DisACPOS increased, but ACPA did not vary with advancing ages in children. OS was located more posteriorly in children compared with adults. Most of ACP pneumatization was seen after prepubescent period.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view stacking is a framework for combining information from different views (i.e. different feature sets) describing the same set of objects. In this framework, a <i>base-learner</i> algorithm is trained on each view separately, and their predictions are then combined by a <i>meta-learner</i> algorithm. In a previous study, stacked penalized logistic regression, a special case of multi-view stacking, has been shown to be useful in identifying which views are most important for prediction. In this article we expand this research by considering seven different algorithms to use as the meta-learner, and evaluating their view selection and classification performance in simulations and two applications on real gene-expression data sets. Our results suggest that if both view selection and classification accuracy are important to the research at hand, then the nonnegative lasso, nonnegative adaptive lasso and nonnegative elastic net are suitable meta-learners. Exactly which among these three is to be preferred depends on the research context. The remaining four meta-learners, namely nonnegative ridge regression, nonnegative forward selection, stability selection and the interpolating predictor, show little advantages in order to be preferred over the other three.

    "abstract": "Family caregivers of persons with neurocognitive disorders sometimes experience heightened emotional burden (i.e., caregiver burden), presenting with symptoms of depression and anxiety. The stress of caregiving may be heightened among those who identify as women, who experience disproportionate rates and consequences of the caregiving role. This case study highlights the use of Caregiver Family Therapy (CFT; i.e., a systems-directed approach targeting the caregiver role and network) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; i.e., an individual-directed approach targeting maladaptive cognitions) with a cisgender White woman caregiving for her spouse, a cisgender man with Parkinson's disease. The patient reported elevated caregiver burden, depression, and anxiety at intake. Treatment targeted modifications to the caregiving role, maladaptive cognitions, and behavioral activation, often with a focus on the role of gender in shaping the caregiving role and core beliefs about caregiving. Over 20 sessions, the patient reported reductions in anxiety (Geriatric Anxiety Inventory = -6), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale-30 = -10), and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview-12: -20), which were maintained over two booster sessions (6 weeks). This case highlights the benefit of integrating systems- and individual-focused psychotherapies with caregivers as well as the important role of gender in addressing caregiving-related psychological distress.",

    "abstract": "Although some pollutants emitted in vehicle exhaust, such as benzene, are known to cause leukaemia in adults with high exposure levels, less is known about the relationship between traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and childhood haematologic cancer. In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the U.S., which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood haematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukaemia and lymphoma.",

Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, anthropometric, biochemical, food consumption and blood pressure data were collected from individuals ≥ 20 years old, of both sexes, living in Teresina (Piauí). Of the 262 participants, 38.2% were aged 20 to 39 years and 61.8%, ≥ 40 years old. Individuals aged ≥ 40 years returned higher prevalence of MS (57.4%), hyperglycaemia (13%), hypertension (54.9%) and high waist circumference (50.6%). At 20 to 39 years of age, prevalence of MS was 23%, while blood glucose, blood pressure and waist circumference were normal in 99%, 78% and 77%, respectively. In the total sample, UPFs accounted for 20% of total calorie intake, but 24.4% in the group aged 20 to 39 years and 17% in the group ≥ 40 years. Individuals aged ≥ 40 years in the highest tercile of UPF consumption returned 35% higher prevalence of MS. Excessive consumption of UPF should be discouraged and the consumption of fresh/minimally processed foods, encouraged, with a view to guaranteeing population health.",

The current study examined the relationship between Dark Triad constructs and cyberstalking among a large sample of adults (<i>N</i> = 1724) while addressing several limitations of previous research. Each construct was assessed using a validated measure; a newer measure of Machiavellianism was used to ensure that psychopathy and Machiavellianism could be distinguished; and separate models were run for each trait to avoid interpreting residuals from multivariate models. After controlling for age and sex, only the antisocial facet of psychopathy (early and repeated antisocial behaviour; odds ratio, <i>OR</i> = 2.74, 95% confidence interval, CI [1.73, 4.36]) and grandiose narcissism (inflated self-esteem and antagonism; <i>OR</i> = 1.27, 95% CI [1.08, 1.50]) were significantly related to cyberstalking perpetration within the past 12 months. While psychopathy and narcissism may be important factors for understanding antisocial behaviour, Machiavellianism appears to have limited predictive and practical utility.",

This study investigated the contributions of integrative community therapy (ICT) in treating individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a specialized medical outpatient clinic. This qualitative study involved 20 users with T2DM who participated in ICT sessions and individual interviews. The analysis revealed five main themes: 1) contributions of ICT to diabetes management; 2) diabetes: the discovery of the disease; 3) diabetes: the patient and the family; 4) living with the \"enemy\"; and 5) diabetes: denial, acceptance and faith. ICT proved to have contributed to the therapeutic approach for individuals with T2DM, serving as a space for dialog, exchange of knowledge, and experiences regarding the daily lives of people with T2DM, which go beyond the context of health and disease. The importance of complementary approaches in the management of chronic conditions such as T2DM is highlighted.",

A 49-year-old male patient, with a history of chronic renal insufficiency on renal replacement therapy and anticoagulation treatment, presented with sudden painful proptosis 1 week after four-petal evisceration. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hyperintense area suggestive of hemorrhage around the implant. Initial management involved intravenous steroid therapy to alleviate symptoms. Despite the administration of steroids, the patient's proptosis and associated symptoms persisted. This led to the decision to perform surgical intervention. The surgical procedure encompassed the removal of the silicone implant, evacuation of the hemorrhage, and subsequently reinsertion of the same implant. Postoperatively, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. To our knowledge, this report represents the first case of early orbital hemorrhage developed following four-petal evisceration. This case underscores the potential for the development of early orbital hemorrhage following four-petal evisceration. Prompt recognition and appropriate surgical intervention are crucial for the management of the hemorrhage and preserving orbital function.",

However, few studies have examined dynamic RSA within tasks and relations to parent and child anxiety. Using piecewise growth modelling and multimethod baseline data from an intervention study of 151 3.5-5-year-old children and their parents, we examined relations between child social anxiety (SA), parent anxiety and their interaction in predicting children's RSA across social stressor tasks (e.g. learning about unfamiliar peers, Trier Social Stress). Within the sample, 49.63% of children were reported to be White, non-Hispanic/Latine (<i>n</i> = 67), 22% multiracial (<i>n</i> = 31), 14.81% Asian/Pacific Islander (<i>n</i> = 20) and 12.59% Black/African-American (<i>n</i> = 17).

Children showed differentiated RSA reactivity and recovery within an anticipatory social learning task based on their level of clinically appraised SA. Relations between child SA and RSA across tasks was moderated by parent anxiety, specifically for dyads matched in anxiety.

The current PRISMA guided systematic review aimed to evaluate standardised capacity assessment tools used in the child/adolescent population, and to examine the relationship between these capacity assessment tools and cognition. Inclusion criteria comprised: (1) validation of a new/existing tool to assess capacity or competence; (2) participants < 18 years; (3) involved validation on normative or non-normative populations; (4) published in English in a peer review journal. Ten studies were included. The majority applied a version of the Macarthur Competence Assessment Tool. Findings suggest capacity assessment tools demonstrate sound psychometric properties, but research into capacity assessment in children is still in its infancy. Limitations include the lack of diagnostic gold standard of capacity and the inconsistent and minimal incorporation of cognitive functioning into standardised capacity assessment.",

    "abstract": "The scope of this study was to identify psychosocial repercussions and factors related to the experience of domestic violence within the family. It involved a quantitative, analytical study conducted with students from public schools in the urban area of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul. The sample was calculated considering a 95% confidence interval, in a population of 43,796 students, corresponding to 381 students. As cluster sampling was used, with a design effect, the sample size was doubled (n = 762). Data was collected on individual variables of the students and their guardians; the students responded to the diagnostic phrases of the domestic violence inventory (DVI). The Social Exclusion Index was used as a contextual variable. The data was subjected to multilevel statistical analysis using R and SAS programs. Approximately one-third of the participants experienced domestic violence within the family, with significant psychosocial repercussions. This experience was related to both individual and contextual factors. The conclusion drawn was that the experience of domestic violence within the family resulted in psychosocial repercussions on the emotional and behavioral subscales of the DVI and was associated with the older age groups of students and medium and high levels of social exclusion.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a metabolic condition characterized by increased body fat mass. Increased prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and increased atherogenicity are closely associated with morbidity and mortality in obesity patients. In this study, we investigated the effect of orlistat, a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor, on atherogenicity-related and NASH-related indexes in obese patients. This retrospective study was completed with a total of 139 class III obesity patients with NASH who were admitted to our hospital, creating an orlistat treatment group and a control group. NASH-related indices and atherogenicity indices were calculated at the beginning of the study. These parameters were repeated in the 12<sup>th</sup> week of the study. Statistical analyzes were performed on the entire patient population and in groups classified according to body mass index (BMI) (BMI <40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and BMI ≥40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). As a result of our 12-week study, in addition to the improvement in glycemic parameters and lipid profile, atherogenic indexes (Triglyceride-Glucose index and Triglyceride-Glucose-BMI index) and NASH-related indices (Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score, Fibrosis-4 Index, Aspartate aminotransferase-Platelet Ratio Index) superior improvements were achieved compared to the control group (p<0.001). These improvements were similar in groups separated by BMI (p>0.05). In addition to its proven body weight loss effect, Orlistat may be beneficial in the treatment of atherogenicity and steatohepatitis.",

    "abstract": "While associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and intimate partner violence (IPV) have been well-documented, few studies have identified relationship factors that buffer this association. Even fewer studies have examined these relationships among Latino sexual minority men (SMM). To address this gap, we tested a model in which relationship functioning moderated this association in a sample of Latino SMM couples. Data were collected from 95 couples (190 participants) using a sequential index-partner recruitment design. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models were calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Among men whose partners scored low on the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale, those who reported 1 or more ACEs reported more forms of IPV victimization. In contrast, the association between the actor effect of ACEs and IPV victimization was not significant among those whose partners scored high on the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. In a symmetrical pattern, among men who scored low on the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, those whose partners reported 1 or more ACEs reported more forms of IPV victimization; however, at high levels of self-reported relationship functioning, partner-reported ACEs were relatively associated with fewer reported forms of IPV victimization. These results are consistent with the premise that relationship functioning may serve as one source of resilience, attenuating the association between ACEs and IPV victimization among a sample of coupled Latino SMM. We interpret these findings within the larger IPV literature and provide suggestions for IPV prevention program development, with a particular emphasis on reaching Latino SMM.",

This study aims to extend existing research by (a) measuring polysubstance use through objective drug testing rather than fallible self-reports, (b) determining the most frequent three- and four-substance combinations instead of being limited to typical two-substance combinations, and (c) examining a comprehensive panel of substances beyond those commonly studied. Participants were a convenience sample of individuals applying for methadone maintenance treatment in 11 clinics across 7 states (n= 1098, 43.2% female). Participants voluntarily provided oral fluid and urine specimens to the study during clinic intake that were tested for 22 types of substances by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Polysubstance use was high (89.6%), with the mean number of substances used by participants = 3.3, up to a maximum of 11. There were ten three-substance combinations with prevalences of 5% or greater, the most frequent being opiates, fentanyl and cocaine (10.5%). There were nine four-substance combinations with prevalences of 2% or greater, the most frequent being opiates, fentanyl, cocaine and cannabis (4.5%). Many of these combinations can produce serious and even life-threatening interactions and side effects. The combination with perhaps the most severe potential consequence of concurrent use is the combination of opiates, fentanyl, and tramadol (5.1%), which all have sedative or central nervous system (CNS) depressive effects. Clinicians should consider that symptoms of substance use are likely due to diverse combinations of substances, not only problematic use of a single presenting \"substance of choice.\"",

    "abstract": "The GATA1 and GATA2 transcription factors play a central role in early cell fate decisions in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Although the switch from GATA2 to GATA1 occupancy at GATA-binding sites in erythroblast-specific genes has been extensively studied, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling this switch are not fully elucidated. An antisense promoter in the 5' region of the <i>GATA2</i> gene produces a long non-coding RNA that has been shown to affect <i>GATA2</i> transcription and erythroblast differentiation. The recent identification of an antisense promoter in the first intron of the <i>GATA1</i> gene indicates that similar promoter competition mechanisms operate in these genes, potentially controlling GATA1/GATA2 levels in a probabilistic manner. In the current study we perform a comprehensive evaluation of <i>GATA1</i> and <i>GATA2</i> transcripts in human CD34 <sup>+</sup> progenitors either freshly isolated or differentiated in vitro and the human leukemia cell lines K562 and HL60. The ratio of competing sense and antisense transcripts varied significantly with differentiation status, suggesting that promoter competition controls cell fate decisions. Treatment of HL60 cells with differentiating agents resulted in significant changes in the ratio of <i>GATA2</i> sense to antisense promoter activity, in agreement with previous results showing that sense and antisense transcription are associated with distinct cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the extent to which the association between housing tenure and disability-free life years is independent of socio-demographic circumstances from earlier in life. We analysed nationally representative data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. Participants were followed up for 14 years (2001-2014). Housing tenure was measured by the question, \"Do you (or any other members of this household) own this home, rent it, or do you live here rent-free?\" Disability was defined by the SF-36 physical function subscale. We used multistate modelling and inverse probability weighting to estimate the association between housing tenure (home ownership vs renting) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE), adjusting for a range of socio-demographic indicators. The sample included 6164 participants (52.5% women) aged 45 years and older in 2001. In weighted analyses that adjusted for earlier life circumstances, for men, the estimated total life expectancy (TLE) at age 65 among renters was 16.7 years, 2.3 (95% CI -3.7 to -0.7) years shorter than the TLE of 19.0 years for owner-occupiers. DFLE was 1.8 years shorter for renters than owner-occupiers. For women at age 65, the weighted TLE was estimated to be 20.6 years, 2.3 (95% CI -3.9 to -0.6) years shorter than the 22.9 years estimated for owner-occupiers. Compared with owner-occupiers, DFLE was 3.1 years shorter for women renters. Both men and women renters had shorter disability-free and TLE than owner-occupiers independent of earlier life circumstances. There is a need for policies addressing potential health disparities linked to housing tenure.",

    "abstract": "Despite the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine, they may generate responses lacking supporting evidence or based on hallucinated evidence. While Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) is popular to address this issue, few studies implemented and evaluated RAG in downstream domain-specific applications. We developed a RAG pipeline with ~70,000 ophthalmology-specific documents that retrieve relevant documents to augment LLMs during inference time. In a case study on long-form consumer health questions, we systematically evaluated the responses - including over 500 references - of LLMs with and without RAG on 100 questions with 10 healthcare professionals. The evaluation focuses on factuality of evidence, selection and ranking of evidence, attribution of evidence, and answer accuracy and completeness. LLMs without RAG provided 252 references in total. Of which, 45.3% hallucinated, 34.1% consisted of minor errors, and 20.6% were correct. In contrast, LLMs with RAG significantly improved accuracy (54.5% being correct) and reduced error rates (18.8% with minor hallucinations and 26.7% with errors). 62.5% of the top 10 documents retrieved by RAG were selected as the top references in the LLM response, with an average ranking of 4.9. The use of RAG also improved evidence attribution (increasing from 1.85 to 2.49 on a 5-point scale, P<0.001), albeit with slight decreases in accuracy (from 3.52 to 3.23, P=0.03) and completeness (from 3.47 to 3.27, P=0.17). The results demonstrate that LLMs frequently exhibited hallucinated and erroneous evidence in the responses, raising concerns for downstream applications in the medical domain. RAG substantially reduced the proportion of such evidence but encountered challenges. In contrast to existing studies, the results highlight that (1) LLMs may not select top-ranked documents by RAG, which results in hallucinated evidence remaining, (2) LLMs may miss top-ranked documents by RAG, and (3) irrelevant documents by RAG downgrade response accuracy and completeness, especially in challenging tasks such as long-form question answering. In conclusion, in long-form medical question answering, the RAG approach demonstrated improved effectiveness over non-RAG approach. Nevertheless, there are still challenges in evidence retrieval, selection, and attribution, highlighting the need for further development in domain-specific LLM and RAG techniques.",

Chi-square test was used to test association. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Only 24.9% of the respondents had good knowledge and 58.8% had moderate knowledge about tuberculosis. Students studying B.Sc. nursing knew more about tuberculosis than those studying General Nursing. 67.4% of students had good attitude towards tuberculosis. Practice towards various aspects of tuberculosis was not satisfactory in more than 50% of the students. Most of the nursing students have moderate knowledge about tuberculosis, but their attitude and practice towards TB is not at satisfactory level. Hence specific training measures should be included in their curriculum to improve their knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding tuberculosis. This will help in early diagnosis and proper treatment of TB.",

There was an increase in the prevalence of information about the reference service for childbirth (75.1% to 83.2%) and the performance of the syphilis test (66.4% to 79.8%), although the prevalence is still below ideal. Most women gave birth through the SUS (70%), and the main professional involved in childbirth was the doctor (87%). The presence of companions during childbirth tripled in the evaluated years, but cesarean rates remain high. There have been advances in prenatal and childbirth care in Brazil in the two evaluated periods.

    "abstract": "Despite multiple treatments for tuberculosis (TB), there are ≈10 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths annually, warranting the need for new therapeutics. Major clinical treatment issues include the length of treatment which is associated with patient non-compliance; and poor cellular drug penetration leading to the generation of drug-resistant strains. This study underscores the potential of <i>β-</i>glucan-chitosan (CS) poly(lactic co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles as a promising immunostimulatory adjunct for TB treatment. To facilitate drug delivery to alveolar macrophage, a CS-PLGA nanoparticle is developed containing rifampin in the core with <i>β-</i>glucan as a surface ligand, to stimulate the immune system. Mice are administered a single dose of nanoparticles or free rifampin by oropharyngeal aspiration. Pharmacokinetic investigations reveal sustained release properties of rifampin in vivo, extending over a week. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis indicates stimulation of the innate immune system, as evidenced by cytokine profiling, while concurrently revealing no detrimental effects on the alveolar epithelium, as indicated by histological examination and albumin lung leak assessment. These findings collectively establish a strong foundation for the development of a novel adjuvant immunotherapy approach for TB.",

    "title": "Characterizing the Prevalence and Perpetrators of Documented Fatal Violence Against Black Transgender Women in the United States (2013-2021).",
    "abstract": "The epidemic of fatal violence against Black transgender women in the United States requires immediate response. We conducted secondary analyses of public databases with 229 documented acts of fatal violence against transgender women; Black transgender women accounted for 78.6%. Significantly more Black transgender women were fatally shot by a gun (<i>p </i>< .001) and killed younger (<i>p </i>= .002) than non-Black transgender women. Perpetrators were identified in 54% of cases, among whom 75% were Black cisgender men. Most Black transgender women (64.6%) had romantic/sexual relationships with the perpetrator. Findings call for violence prevention responses that reduce Black transgender women's vulnerability to violence and engage Black cisgender men seeking intimate relationships with Black transgender women.",

    "abstract": "Degenerative wrist disease may have varying etiologies, but solutions to deal with this debilitating condition center around several common management pathways. Once nonoperative measures have been exhausted, generally there is a choice between motion sparing procedures or a total wrist arthrodesis. The appropriateness of motion sparing procedures will be dictated by the extent and pattern of degeneration, and midcarpal arthrosis is typically a contraindication to a proximal row carpectomy. One solution to this problem is to employ a Resurfacing Capitate Pyrocarbon Implant. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and effectiveness of this operation by systematically reviewing the literature. The findings of this review support the use of this implant in the setting of degenerative wrist disease, with reported outcomes comparable to similar operations. However, this is based on overall low numbers of reported outcomes with a reasonable chance of bias. <b>Level of Evidence</b>  Level III.",

    "abstract": "Controlled human infection models offer a unique opportunity to understand infectious disease pathogenesis and have accelerated vaccine development and evaluations in malaria and typhoid. One major limitation of most CHIMs is that they are typically conducted in healthy young adults who are generally the population least affected by infectious disease, and who exhibit distinct disease profiles to more at-risk populations such as people living with HIV, young children, and older adults. However, the added value of studying these populations with high relevance is only desirable if it can be done safely, robustly and acceptably. We present a framework to guide the conduct of a controlled human infection model in people living with HIV using a case-example of an experimental human pneumococcal carriage model in a setting of high disease-burden and transmission.",

    "abstract": "Dexamethasone is widely used in anesthesia practise as prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Our aims were to evaluate the postoperative glycemic profile after a single dose of intraoperative dexamethasone in non-diabetic and diabetic patients and to evaluate the PONV. This double-blinded, randomized, controlled study was done for 6 months from June to December 2024 in a tertiary care hospital after obtaining ethical committee clearance and CTRI registration. Patients were allocated to one of four groups: nondiabetics receiving saline, nondiabetics receiving dexamethasone, diabetics receiving saline, and diabetics receiving dexamethasone. The study drug or saline control was administered at the induction of anesthesia. Blood sugar values, two hours after dexamethasone/placebo administration as well as fasting blood sugar and postprandial blood sugar on postoperative day 1, 2 were taken as primary endpoints. PONV was assessed in the first 24 hours after surgery. The rise in blood glucose levels was higher in the group receiving dexamethasone compared to saline in both diabetics and nondiabetics (P < 0.05). None of the patients had blood glucose values more than 180 mg/dL after 2 hours and 8 hours of dexamethasone administration. Dexamethasone can be considered as prophylaxis for PONV in well controlled diabetics and nondiabetics despite the increase in blood glucose levels as a hyperglycemic response (blood glucose value 180 mg/dL) to a single dose was not observed in our study.",

Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 57, No. 11, pp. 2599-2613, 2025. The evidence supporting the many beneficial effects of physical activity, including exercise, is overwhelming. This has led to numerous publications, statements, and position stands providing evidence-based recommendations to realize the performance-enhancing and therapeutic benefits of exercise. However, one factor hampering research and limiting the adoption of these recommendations is the inconsistent use of terminology associated with different exercise intensities. The goal of this international group of researchers and practitioners, therefore, was to propose standardized physical activity and exercise intensity terminology that has utility across all ages, sexes, genders, physical abilities, conditions, applications, and activities. After much discussion, we propose a standard terminology for physical activity, exercise, and sport and human performance comprising five exercise intensities: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. We also propose five different descriptors for the perception of effort that align with the five intensities we have suggested: very easy, easy, somewhat hard, hard, and very hard. To enable consistent use of these descriptors with both cardiorespiratory and resistance exercise, we suggest not using descriptors such as light, heavy, weak, or strong (which might be perceived as only being applicable to describing load). We appreciate that some fields have long-established terminology and may be reluctant to change. Nonetheless, at a minimum, the terminology proposed here allows for more clarity when comparing the different exercise intensity descriptors currently used by different fields. Finally, we hope this will be an important \"first step\" in harmonizing the descriptions of exercise intensity across the fields of physical activity for public health, exercise science, and sport science.",

In addition, it was aimed to investigate the relationship between this findings and the presence of psychopathology, emotion regulation skills and styles of coping with stress in their mothers. The study included 70 diabetic,70 healthy children and their mothers. During the evaluation, the Children's Depression Inventory, the Screen for Children Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Eating Attitudes Test(EAT), the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory(PedsQL) and Ways of Coping Inventory (COPE) were applied to all children. In addition, DERS, COPE, Beck depression and Beck anxiety scales were applied to all mothers. It was found significantly more problems in diabetic group in the DERS-impulse subscale, COPE-helplessness, PedsQL-physical subgroup, EAT, SCARED scores experienced than the control group. In the scales applied to mothers of diabetic children, significantly higher scores were found in the DERS-nonacceptance subscale, deficits in emotional clarity subscale and impulse subscale, COPE-helplessness subgroup,and Beck Depression Scale.

    "abstract": "The spindle cells of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) lesions primarily express Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) latent genes with minimal expression of lytic genes. However, recent transcriptome analyses of KS lesions have shown high expression of KSHV open reading frame (ORF) 75, which is considered a late lytic gene based on analyses in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) lines. ORF75 encodes a pseudo-amidotransferase that is part of the viral tegument, acts as a suppressor of innate immunity, and is essential for viral lytic replication. We assessed a representative KS lesion by RNAscope and found that ORF75 RNA was expressed in the majority of latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)-expressing cells. Luciferase fusion reporter constructs of the ORF75 promoter were analyzed for factors potentially driving its expression in KS. The ORF75 promoter construct showed high basal transcriptional activity <i>in vitro</i> in endothelial cells, mediated by a proximal consensus specificity protein 1 (Sp1) (GGGGCGGGGC) element along with two distal CCAAT boxes. Sp proteins formed complexes with the proximal consensus Sp1 element to activate ORF75 promoter transcription. We also found evidence that a repressive factor or factors in B cells, but not endothelial or epithelial cells, interacted with more distal elements in the ORF75 promoter region to repress constitutive ORF75 expression in B cells. Alternate forms of Sp1 were found to accumulate during latency and showed substantial enrichment during viral lytic replication in PEL cells and infected endothelial cells, but their functional significance is unclear. We also found that ORF75 can in turn upregulate its own expression and that of other KSHV genes. Thus, while ORF75 acts primarily as a lytic gene in PEL cell lines, Sp proteins induce substantial constitutive ORF75 transcription in infected endothelial cells and this can account for its high expression in KS lesions.",

    "abstract": "The role of magnesium supplementation in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes (GD) has not been elucidated. To evaluate the effect of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) on the risk of developing GD in a model of obese rats with hydrochlorothiazide-induced hypomagnesemia. Female Wistar rats were allocated into a healthy control or obese group. Obesity was induced with an obesogenic diet and defined by a body weight 30% higher than that of the healthy control group. Once obesity was induced and before pregnancy, hypomagnesemia was generated using hydrochlorothiazide (5 mg/kg body weight). Subsequently, the oestrous cycle was evaluated to proceed for mating. Once pregnancy was confirmed, the obese rats were allocated to an intervention group (IG) or control group (HOCG). Rats in the IG received MgCl2 (50 mg/kg body weight, equivalent to 500 mg per day in humans). Fasting glucose and ionized magnesium levels were determined on days 6, 15, and 20 of pregnancy. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed on day 15 of pregnancy. Rats in the IG had significantly increased ionized magnesium (p=0.009), decreased fasting (p=0.02) and two-hour post-load (p=0.04) glucose levels, and exhibited lower body weight gain than the HOCG (p<0.05). At the end of the study, 75% of the rats in the HOCG, but none in the IG, fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for GD. In obese hypomagnesaemic rats, magnesium supplementation, using MgCl2, reduces fasting and two-hour post-load glucose levels as well as the risk of developing GD, and induces lower body weight gain during pregnancy.",

    "title": "The Role of PET Scan in Conscious Rats With Neuropathic Pain: Differential Changes in Brain Glucose Metabolic Activity in Spontaneous Versus Allodynia Pain.",
    "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is caused by lesions in the somatosensory nervous system. Pain occurs spontaneously, and responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli are pathologically amplified. Despite the abundant functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in awake human subjects, there is no available report on the behavioral correlate of differential brain areas involved in spontaneous and evoked pain symptoms in a conscious animal model. We investigated whether positron emission tomography (PET) imaging could depict the spatial changes in glucose metabolic activity in the awake male rat brain during spontaneous- and evoked-pain conditions on a spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain. Two major branches of the sciatic nerve, the tibial and common peroneal nerves, were transected under anesthesia. Two PET experiments were performed. In the spontaneous pain behavior group, abnormal paw-lifting behaviors were recorded during fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. In the allodynia group, the ipsilateral side of the lesion hindpaw was stimulated with a 6-g von Frey fi lament once every 5 seconds for 20 minutes during FDG uptake. Each rat was scanned twice in both experiments: once before and once from 3 to 7 days after SNI surgery. Nerves were isolated but not transected in the sham-operated control group. After SNI surgery, rats displayed spontaneous jerky paw lifting and mechanical sensitization lasting at least 4 weeks. In the spontaneous pain behavior group, glucose metabolic activity in the SNI condition significantly increased in the ipsilateral posterior insular cortex (PIC) compared to pre-surgery and the sham-operated controls. The glucose metabolic activity of the PIC was linearly correlated with the frequency of spontaneous paw lifting. In the allodynia group, changes in glucose metabolic activities in the SNI condition significantly increased in the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex, contralateral primary motor cortex, ipsilateral secondary motor cortex, ipsilateral rostral insular cortex, PIC, hypothalamus, medial thalamus (including the medial dorsal nucleus and anterior periventricular thalamic nucleus), and medial cerebellum. Differential brain areas in rats with peripheral neuropathic pain were activated between mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain-related behaviors. The data suggest that PET is a useful imaging technique to establish the link between behavioral correlates and topographical representation in awake rats suffering from spontaneous pain and allodynia of neuropathic pain.",

    "title": "QUANTILE REGRESSION DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS OF DISPARITY RESEARCH USING COMPLEX SURVEY DATA: APPLICATION TO DISPARITIES IN BMI AND TELOMERE LENGTH BETWEEN U.S. MINORITY AND WHITE POPULATION GROUPS.",
    "abstract": "We develop a quantile regression decomposition (QRD) method for analyzing observed disparities (OD) between population groups in socioeconomic and health-related outcomes for complex survey data. The conventional decomposition approaches use the conditional mean regression to decompose the disparity into two parts, the part explained by the difference arising from the different distributions in the explanatory covariates and the remaining part, which is unexplained by the covariates. Many socioeconomic and health outcomes exhibit heteroscedastic distributions, where the magnitude of observed disparities varies across different quantiles of these outcomes. Thus, differences in the explanatory covariates may account for varying differences in the OD across the quantiles of the outcome. The QRD can identify where there are greater differences in the outcome distribution, for example, 90th quantile, and how important the covariates are in explaining those differences. Much socioeconomic and health research relies on complex surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), that oversample individuals from disadvantaged/minority population groups in order to provide improved precision. QRD has not been extended to the complex survey setting. We improve the QRD approach proposed in Machado and Mata (2005) to yield more reliable estimates at the quantiles, where the data are sparse, and extend it to the complex survey setting. We also propose a perturbation-based variance estimation method. Simulation studies indicate that the estimates of the unexplained portions of the OD across quantiles are unbiased and the coverage of the confidence intervals are close to nominal value. This methodology is used to study disparities in body mass index (BMI) and telomere length between race/ethnic groups estimated from the NHANES data.",

    "abstract": "Tegmen dehiscence with encephalocele presents certain surgical challenges, necessitating innovative approaches to improve patient outcomes and minimize complications. Here we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel middle cranial fossa craniotomy technique. Nineteen adult patients with radiographically confirmed tegmen dehiscence with encephalocele were included. Patients underwent a middle cranial fossa craniotomy technique for tegmen dehiscence repair, utilizing a split-thickness bone graft, pedicled pericranial flap, and hydroxyapatite for extradural repair and with an inlay graft for the intradural repair. The primary outcome measured was the major perioperative complications or need for revision surgery, while the secondary outcome measured was the resolution or improvement of preoperative symptoms associated with tegmen dehiscence. Our series encompassed tegmen dehiscence repairs in 19 patients, with an average age at surgery of 51 years (range: 24-82 years). The average follow-up time was 8.80 months (range: 0.43-27.62 months). Patients commonly presented with symptoms such as hearing loss ( <i>n</i>  = 8), otorrhea ( <i>n</i>  = 8), fullness or ear pressure ( <i>n</i>  = 6), dizziness or imbalance ( <i>n</i>  = 6), or a history of meningitis ( <i>n</i>  = 4), among others. Postoperatively, symptoms resolved completely in 42% of patients ( <i>n</i>  = 8) and partially in 58% of patients ( <i>n</i>  = 11). Notably, no patients required revision surgery or developed new dehiscence in the follow-up period. Our middle cranial fossa craniotomy technique for tegmen dehiscence with encephalocele repair demonstrated promising postoperative outcomes, with complete or partial symptom resolution in all patients and no major complications. Our findings suggest that this technique is a safe and effective approach for tegmen dehiscence repair.",

A retrospective comparative case series was conducted, categorizing eyes into two groups: Group A, without DM baring, and Group B, with central DM baring. All DALK surgeries for MCD conducted between January 2010 and August 2020 at our institution were included in this study. The study comprised 29 eyes from 18 patients with a mean follow-up period of 54.85 months. Type 1 bubble was achieved in 4 eyes (13.8%), type 2 or mixed bubbles were formed in 19 eyes (65.5%), and failed big bubble formation occurred in 6 eyes (20.7%). Group A (non-DM baring) comprised 18 eyes (62.1%), while Group B (central DM baring) included 11 eyes (37.9%). No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of best-corrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent, or topographic astigmatism. However, Group B demonstrated significantly improved contrast sensitivity (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Group A displayed persistent or recurrent MCD opacities in 11 eyes (73.3%), whereas none were observed in Group B, demonstrating a statistically significant difference (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The incidence of type 2 or mixed bubbles in MCD cases is relatively high, facilitating central DM baring. In this series, central DM baring correlated with improved contrast sensitivity and prevented MCD opacities recurrence. Thus, it should be considered in all DALK cases for MCD if a type 2 bubble is formed.",

In this randomized controlled double-blind trial, 70 patients scheduled for strabismus surgery were enrolled and divided into two groups. Group O (oral, <i>n</i> = 32) received 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam and Group N (nebulized, <i>n</i> = 33) received 0.5 mg/kg midazolam through nebulization. Our outcomes included satisfactory sedation of patients, parental separation anxiety, mask acceptance scores, and perioperative hemodynamics up to 30 min postpremedication. A significant difference in oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) at the 30<sup>th</sup> min emerged between nebulized and oral midazolam (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Ramsay Sedation scores within 30 min demonstrated comparable sedation levels between Groups N and O. Face mask acceptance scores were excellent in both groups, with no significant differences. Parental separation anxiety scores and the mask acceptance score at the 30<sup>th</sup> min revealed no statistically significant differences at various time points (<i>P</i> > 0.05). In pediatric patients undergoing ophthalmic surgeries, nebulized midazolam is as effective as oral midazolam for sedation.

    "abstract": "To review the results of gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) in patients with advanced glaucoma. GATT has shown efficacy in mild to moderate cases of glaucoma. Its efficacy in advanced glaucoma is uncertain, though recent studies show promising short-term outcomes. A retrospective chart review of advanced glaucoma patients undergoing GATT with or without cataract surgery from January 2018 to April 2023 was conducted. Complete success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) <14 mmHg with ≥30% reduction from baseline (Criteria A) or IOP <18 mmHg and/or ≥20% reduction (Criteria B), without antiglaucoma medications. Qualified success was defined as attainment of the same with a maximum of 2 medications. A total of 69 eyes from 60 patients (mean age, 61.2 ± 15.3 years) were included in the study. The mean IOP decreased from 24.9 ± 10.7 mmHg preoperatively to 12.1 ± 3.0 mmHg at 6 months postoperatively. At 6 months, the complete success rate (based on Criteria A) was 66.7%, with an overall success rate of 81.9%. By 1 year (<i>n</i> = 52), these rates were 51.9% and 65.4%, respectively. Using Criteria B, the complete success rate was 74.2%, and the overall success rate was 95.4% at 6 months, decreasing to 57.7% and 82.7% at 1 year. Patients who had used antiglaucoma medications for <2 weeks before surgery showed significantly higher success rates at both 6 months (<i>P</i> = 0.01) and 1 year (<i>P</i> = 0.019). Combining GATT with cataract surgery also improved success rates at 6 months (<i>P</i> = 0.005). In addition, six eyes with previously failed trabeculectomy achieved success at 6 months, with five remaining successful at 1 year. Three eyes experienced delayed bleeds with an IOP spike, all of which met failure criteria during the follow-up. GATT demonstrates encouraging short-term outcomes in advanced glaucoma, particularly in treatment-naïve patients and those undergoing combined cataract surgery. However, delayed bleeds can lead to IOP spikes and treatment failure. GATT may be considered as a viable surgical option in treatment naïve patients with advanced glaucoma. Its efficacy is bolstered when combined with cataract surgery.",

    "abstract": "Mulberry (<i>Morus nigra</i>) is recognized for its nutrient-dense and health benefits. This study aimed to enhance the bioactivities (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic) of modified cottage cheese by incorporating mulberry juice and fermenting with <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> TAR4 (LAB). Initially, enzyme treatments (pectinase, amylase) on mulberry juice assessed total phenolic content (TPC), flavonoids content (TFC), DPPH activity (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), albumin denaturation inhibition (ADI) and α-amylase inhibition (AI) activities. Optimal mulberry juice, showing highest bioactivities, was added to cheese. Bioactivity stability during simulated in-vitro digestion was tested. Results showed that pectinase-treated mulberry juice had highest DPPH (37.01 ± 0.24%), FRAP (84.38 ± 1.73 mg Fe<sup>2+</sup>/g dried mulberry), ADI (30.47 ± 0.57%), and AI (71.11 ± 2.55%). Adding 5% (w/w) mulberry juice significantly increased TPC, TFC, ADI, and AI in cheese (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Post-intestinal digestion, mulberry cheese maintained high TPC (15.77 ± 0.07 mg GAE/g cheese) and FRAP (3.75 ± 0.17 mg Fe<sup>2+</sup>/g cheese), while LAB-fermented mulberry cheese (mulberry-LAB) exhibited superior AI activity (54.4 ± 0.9%). No significant differences were found in TFC, DPPH and ADI between mulberry and mulberry-LAB cheeses post-intestinal digestion. This study recommends integrating mulberry juice and <i>L. plantarum</i> TAR4 fermentation to enhance the bioactivities of modified cottage cheese, offering a novel approach to boost nutritional and functional properties.",

    "abstract": "One in six people are aged 10-19 years. Adolescence is a unique and formative time. Physical, emotional, and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. Protecting adolescents from adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological well-being, and ensuring access to mental healthcare are critical for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood. Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 7 (14%) 10-19 year-olds experience mental health conditions (1), yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated. Adolescents with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion, discrimination, stigma (affecting readiness to seek help), educational difficulties, risk-taking behaviors, physical ill-health, and human rights violations.",

The exposure variables were self-reported leisure-time screen time, sedentary time measured by accelerometer, and change in screen and sedentary time from age 18 to 22. The main component analysis identified three dietary patterns at age 22: healthy and traditional Brazilian snacks, and sweets. Associations were analyzed by crude and adjusted Poisson Regression (n = 3,396). The adjusted analyses showed associations between longer screen time at age 18 (PR: 1.23; 95%CI: 1.08-1.40) and 22 (PR: 1.23; 95%CI: 1.09-1.39) and greater adherence to the Snacks and Sweets pattern. In addition, high screen time at age 18 and 22 was associated with greater adherence to Snacks and Sweets (PR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.03-1.67) and lower adherence to the Healthy pattern (PR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.48-0.87), compared to consistently low screen time at both ages. No associations were found with sedentary time assessed by an accelerometer. The conclusion drawn was that greater screen time at ages 18 and 22 was associated with adherence to an unhealthy dietary pattern in young adults.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and user satisfaction of the MAIA™ telemedicine platform for postoperative telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Patients undergoing RARP (from April 2022 to January 2023) were divided into Group A, following the standard rehabilitation protocol, and Group B using the MAIA™ platform for the first 30-day post-intervention period. Perioperative, pathological, and functional variables (continence and potency rates, assessed via validated questionnaires) were collected and telerehabilitation protocol's adherence was monitored. The telerehabilitation system included an online platform for medical providers and a patient application, facilitating data acquisition, management, treatment planning, and monitoring. Patient and provider satisfaction were evaluated using the visual analogue scale score and validated telemedicine satisfaction questionnaire. Totally, 227 patients were enrolled. No differences in perioperative or pathological variables were found. Group B had higher potency recovery rates than Group A (<i>p</i>=0.031); the potency recovery rates at 1 month and 3 months for Group B were 45% and 57%, respectively, and in Group A were 34% and 48%, respectively. At the multivariate analysis, MAIA™ use and the nerve-sparing (NS) were independent predictors of erectile function at both 1 month (MAIA™ use: odd ratio [OR] 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-3.63, <i>p</i>=0.018; NS: OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.06-4.12, <i>p</i>=0.034) and 3 months (MAIA™ use: OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.07-3.34, <i>p</i>=0.028; NS: OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.02-3.54, <i>p</i>=0.044). Adherence monitoring revealed 4.6% of patients in Group B reported exercise issues due to pelvic pain onset and 10% did not take oral phosphodiesterase 5-inhibitors due to myalgia. All those patients restarted the rehabilitation program after televisit to address the causing problem, allowing restarting of a rehabilitation program. Patients reported high satisfaction with the MAIA™ platform use (mean visual analogue scale score: 88.7). The MAIA™ telemedicine platform seems to have a role in optimizing early potency recovery after RARP. Patient and provider satisfaction levels were high, emphasizing the user-friendliness of the platform.",

    "abstract": "As the scope of endoscopic techniques continues to evolve in the treatment of advanced sinonasal malignancies, the primary challenge is the reconstruction of the resulting anterior skull base dural defect. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of vascularized pericranial flap reconstruction in addressing anterior skull base defects in sinonasal malignancies, particularly when alternative reconstructive methods, such as nasoseptal flaps, are not viable. We conducted a retrospective review of nine patients who underwent endoscopic resection of sinonasal malignancy followed by vascularized pericranial flap. Our analysis aimed to evaluate the surgical methods utilized, identify any complications that occurred, and assess the postoperative results of the patients. Excluding the singular instance of tension pneumocephalus that emerged during the immediate postoperative period, necessitating surgical intervention, our clinical experience was devoid of any complications, with a median follow-up duration of 18 months. It is worth noting that no cases of cerebrospinal fluid leaks or meningitis were reported. Moreover, the follow-up check endoscopy verified the successful integration of the flap and its efficacious coverage of the resection site. This study underscores the benefits of using vascularized pericranial flaps as an alternative solution for anterior skull base reconstruction in sinonasal malignancies. The availability of the pericranial flap in the local region, along with its robust blood supply, and the positive outcomes observed in this preliminary series collectively indicate its potential as an integral component of multi-layered reconstruction techniques for addressing anterior skull base defects.",

    "abstract": "We examined the role of hearing functions as potential mediators in relationships between noise exposures and abnormal body constitution-related results. Additionally, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the causative connections between hearing problems and bodily composition. Gene connections pertaining to phenotypes of hearing loss and body constitution were obtained from publicly available summary data collected from adult population genome-wide association studies. Colocalization analysis was utilized to scrutinize the genetic associations pertaining to age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) liability and body mass index (BMI) within the SLC39A8 locus. For a comprehensive examination, we employed bi-directional MR encompassing both the 'forward' direction (from the composition of the body to hearing) and the 'reverse' direction. A common causative variable (rs13107325) for BMI and ARHI at the SLC39A8 locus was supported by colocalization analysis, which revealed that the two diseases shared the variant at the SLC39A8 gene. The forward analyses showed that body fat percentage (BFP) was significantly linked with the risk of ARHI (OR = 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93 to 0.98)) and that waist circumference (WC) was favorably associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (OR = 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.97)). We did not find evidence to support a causal relationship between constitution and HL in the reverse MR analysis. Colocalization analysis indicated that the SLC39A8 variant was often the source of high ARHI and BMI risk. In prospective MR, we discovered causal associations between WC and BFP with SNHL and ARHI, respectively. Therefore, our results suggest that lipid metabolic abnormalities leading to adverse health outcome may lead to HL.",

    "abstract": "In September 2017, Hurricane Maria decimated Puerto Rico and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, the destruction of thousands of homes, and the mass migration of hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland. Because of these events, Puerto Rican Hurricane Maria survivors on the U.S. mainland are at risk for depressive symptomatology. The purpose of this study was to examine sources of protection against depressive symptoms in this population, with a focus on identifying protective assets and how such assets are differentially distributed across subsets of survivors. A sample of 319 Puerto Rican Hurricane Maria survivors (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 38.5 years, 77% women) completed surveys of intrapersonal, cultural, and community assets, as well as a measure of depressive symptoms. Results showed that optimism and religiosity at the intrapersonal level, and collective efficacy and community safety at the community level, emerged as significant protective assets against depression. Results from a latent profile analysis revealed four classes of survivors based on their degree and type of protection: High Protection, Safe Community, Moderate Protection, and Low Protection. The High Protection class reported fewer depressive symptoms compared with the Moderate and Low Protection classes but reported similar levels of depressive symptoms as the Safe Community class. Findings suggest that intrapersonal cognitive factors, and community efficacy and safety factors may represent salient assets among hurricane survivors on the U.S. mainland. Findings also illustrate that subsets of Puerto Rican Hurricane Maria survivors vary in their degree and type of protective assets.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. Tumor budding (TB), defined as isolated single cancer cells or small clusters of up to four cells at the invasive front, is an emerging histoprognostic factor associated with aggressiveness in various malignancies. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2 methods: manual on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(≥10). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. 25 patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods (p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age (>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.",

This study aims to investigate the dilemmas, occupational and psychological distresses and professional rewards experienced by nurses working in COVID-19 wards and explore their nature and how they are connected. This qualitative descriptive utilized semi-structured interviews with nurses who worked in COVID-19 wards. The study spanned from January 2022 to March 2023. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze interview transcripts. Twelve nurses (8 women, 4 men) with 4 to 21 years of experience participated. Six participants held managerial positions (three head nurses and three deputy head nurses), alongside six staff nurses. Analysis revealed that nurses experienced significant conflicts related to the risk of infection at work, role execution, organizational challenges, and interpersonal relationships. Concurrently, they reported substantial rewards in their work and in building connections with others. Nurses in COVID-19 wards experienced considerable distress related to COVID-19-related job challenges. Leading to feeling of organizational mistrust. However this demanding environment also provided a renewed sense of job fulfillment, particularly from new interactions. These findings are highlight the dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in balancing the inherent occupational distress with professional rewards.",

    "title": "Impact of Surgeon Volume on Perioperative Complications and Survival to Total Hip Arthroplasty Following Femoral Head Core Decompression.",
    "abstract": "Core decompression is a minimally invasive procedure considered in the treatment of early-stage femoral head osteonecrosis. This procedure is theorized to relieve vascular pressure and promote angiogenesis. Although a less invasive procedure, there are considerations related to learning curve, technique variations, etc. that may affect postoperative complications and longer term adverse events. Adult patients who underwent core decompression with a diagnosis of femoral head osteonecrosis were identified in the 2010-Q3 2021 PearlDiver M157 database. Core decompression surgeon volumes over the entire study period were assessed and divided into ranges: low (<5 procedures), medium (5 ≤ x ≤ 19 cases), and high (>19 cases) volumes. A 1:1:1 match based on age, sex, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index was completed. Rates of 90-day complications were compared with univariable and multivariable analyses. Survival to total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to subsequent hip fracture at both 2 and 5 years were compared by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The low-volume, medium-volume, and high-volume surgeon groups made up 87.5%, 11.9%, and 0.2% of core decompression volume, respectively. This was indicative of 6333 patients undergoing core decompression, and matching based on the surgeon-volume category led to 486 patients per group. No statistically significant differences were observed in shorter term complications and survival to THA or hip fracture at 2 or 5 years. Core decompression is a treatment option often considered for early-stage osteonecrosis. Critically, no differences were found in rates of any assessed complications between the surgeon-volume matched cohorts. These findings suggest that core decompression is a relatively safe procedure for surgeons of varying volume with this technique. Furthermore, this study suggests that higher volume surgeons are not conducting the procedure with expanded indications that might result in greater rates of conversion to THA.",

    "abstract": "The year 2024 marks the 20th year since when free cART was introduced in India. This study reports the clinicopathologic profile and outcomes of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who were diagnosed with lymphoma from Northern India. We also review the outcomes of HIV-associated lymphoma in India reported over the past 2 decades. This study included all PLHIV of age ≥ 12 years who were diagnosed with lymphoma and treated at our center between June 2009 and June 2022. Demographic profile, lymphoma subtype, stage and CD4 count at lymphoma diagnosis, and treatment outcomes were analysed. Forty-eight PLHIV patients were diagnosed with lymphoma during the study period of which 31(64.5%) were diagnosed with AIDS Defining Lymphoma (ADL) while 17 (35.4%) were diagnosed with Non-AIDS Defining Lymphoma. Extra-nodal disease was more common in ADLs as compared to NADLs (87% vs. 23%; <i>p</i> < 0.001). 58% (<i>n</i> = 28) patients were previously known HIV, 42% (<i>n</i> = 20) were diagnosed to have HIV concurrent with lymphoma diagnosis. DLBCL was the most common subtype, diagnosed in 45.8% patients. 79% (38/48) patients received a definitive treatment regimen for lymphoma. The median overall survival of the cohort was 26 months. 5-year OS for patients who received definitive lymphoma therapy was 55.2 ± 9%. On multivariate analysis, the receipt of lymphoma directed therapy (HR:5.6 {95% CI:1.34-23.37}, p value:0.018) and a baseline CD4 count of ≥ 200cells/µL (HR:3.5 {95% CI:1.09-11.26}, p value: 0.035) were predictors of overall survival. The lack of lymphoma-directed therapy and a CD 4 count < 200 cells/µL continue to be a significant factors negatively impacting survival in the contemporary cART era in India.

    "abstract": "Snakebite in children is a medical emergency of significant public health concern. Owing to physiological differences, the potential of snake venom causing tissue damage and long-term sequelae is more pronounced in paediatric age group. We aimed to determine the clinical profile and outcome in children suffering with snake envenomation. The retrospective observational study reviewed the clinical case records of children aged 0-18 years, admitted with features of snake envenomation from January 2021 to December 2022 Demographic profile, clinical features, treatment and outcome were analysed using descriptive statistics. Eleven children with snakebite were admitted during the study period. The mean age of study population was 11.63 (±3.9) years. Nine children (81.8%) were residing in rural area, majority (72.7%) of the children experienced the snakebite between May and August. Extremities were the most commonly affected site as seen in seven (63.6%) children. Pain and swelling at the bite site were the commonest symptoms seen in nine (81.8%) children, neurotoxic features were evident in seven (54.5%) cases, while four (36.3%) cases manifested vasculotoxic features. Invasive ventilatory support was required in four (36.3%) cases and all such children were extubated with successful outcome. Anti-snake venom (ASV) was administered in all 11 children and no adverse reactions were observed. No mortality was reported during the study. Envenomation toxidrome depends on the prevalent snake species inhabiting the various geographic regions within the same country.",

We developed an ERAS protocol for LTx based on previous experience and assessed it using benchmarks from the German Institute for Quality Management and Transparency in Healthcare (IQTIG). An ERAS protocol was developed and implemented in our center since 2018 for LTx, including preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative procedures. From January 2021 to December 31st 2022, we conducted a prospective analysis including donor and recipient demographics, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and medical history. Perioperative management, such as operative time, anhepatic phase time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, morbidity and mortality as well as postoperative hospitalization, readmission and 1-year patient survival, were collected as outcome measures. Sixty-eight consecutive liver transplant recipients were included. Mean age of the donors was 47 (36-55.5) years old, type of donation was in 41 donation after brain death (DBD), 26 donation after controlled circulatory death (DCD) and 1 donation after brain and cardiac death (DBCD). Mean age of the patients was 49.6 years (range, 26-68 years), 81% were male. The mean body mass index (BMI) of the recipients was 24 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 15-37 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), mean MELD score was 15 (range, 6-39), 3 patients had a MELD score higher than 30. Fifty-three patients suffered from hepatitis B virus (HBV) related cirrhosis. Twenty-eight patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); 5 patients were diagnosed with alcohol related cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune disease and drug induced cirrhosis, undefined cirrhosis, respectively. The mean operation time in our cohort was 6.73 hours, and the average anhepatic phase time was 68 minutes. No patient had intraoperative hypothermia. Tracheal extubation was performed in the ICU department within 6 hours post operation and the average ICU/intermediate care (IMC) unit stay was 4.5 days (range, 2-14 days). None of the patients required re-intubation. Postoperative complications with a CDC classification > II were seen in 16 patients (23.5%). Mean hospital stay was 21.7 days and readmission rate was 13 (19%). Neither acute rejection nor postoperative mortality during the hospital stay was recorded. One patient died from acute myocardial infarction after discharge. We developed an ERAS protocol in LTx, consisting of preoperative, perioperative and postoperative management and assessed the quality using benchmarks from IQTIG. Our study revealed that the proposed ERAS approach in LTx is feasible offering the opportunities of enhanced recovery and quality management.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is defined by reduced CSF pressure without an identifiable cause, hallmarked by acute onset of severe postural headache. Overlapping clinical presentation, MRI appearance, laboratory findings and prevalent risk population, may lead to diagnostic challenges in distinguishing SIH from the more common pituitary adenoma apoplexy (PAA). Cardinal MRI characteristics of SIH may be overlooked if sellar region examination is not coupled with a comprehensive cranial MRI examination. Pituitary enlargement in SIH was described with increased prevalence, but mostly as an incidental observation in neuroradiological series, without detailed functional pituitary assessment or follow-up. A young female with SIH presented with an intra-suprasellar mass lesion, imitating PAA. Mildly affected pituitary function, absence of visual impairments, and favourable clinical course influenced the decision against urgent pituitary surgery. Subsequent MRI confirmed spontaneous regression in pituitary size in first 5 months, along with clinical, hormonal and perimetric stability. Her initial mild central hypocortisolism resolved spontaneously, while baseline and follow-up dynamic pituitary assessment revealed no other abnormalities. Subsequent 9 years of endocrinological and neuroradiological follow-up confirmed gradual spontaneous pituitary lesion reduction. Awareness is raised that SIH may constitute a diagnostic pitfall due to clinical, neuroradiologic and laboratory overlapping with PA apoplexy, potentially leading to unnecessary surgery.",

Cd is a trace element that enters into plants through contaminated soil. <i>Serendipita indica</i> is a fungal endophyte which colonizes and benefits exceptionally large group of plants. Roots of 3-days old <i>B. juncea</i> seedlings were inoculated with <i>S. indica</i> and raised in toxic Cd concentrations (10 µM, 30 µM and 50 µM Cd) till 12 days after inoculation in plant growth chamber with conditions of 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod, temperature 25 °C (± 2 °C) and 80% relative humidity. The seedlings were tested for various morpho-physiological parameters like seed germination, plant biomass and %age heavy metal tolerance index. Also, various non-enzymatic antioxidants like vitamin A, vitamin C, phenols, flavonoids, total soluble sugars, reducing and non-reducing sugars were analyzed. Cd led to reduction in the % age germination of <i>B. juncea</i> seeds<i>. Serendipita indica</i> inoculation incremented the growth parameters like fresh weight, dry weight, root length, shoot length which were diminished by Cd stress. Enhancement of 20.66% in root length was observed in inoculated and Cd stressed seedlings. The content of phenols increased under unstressed conditions by 26.6% and by 55.29% under Cd stressed conditions in <i>S. indica</i> inoculated seedlings along with increasing contents of vitamin A and C. Overall, the content of carbohydrates was enhanced with <i>S. indica</i> inoculation. The study suggests that <i>S. indica</i> endophyte has great potential in boosting growth and physiological parameters which help in managing Cd stress in <i>B. juncea</i>.",

    "abstract": "During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies like the Ion Torrent S5 and Illumina MiSeq, alongside advanced software, improved genomic surveillance in South Africa. This study analysed anonymized samples from the Eastern Cape using Genome Detective and NextClade, showing Ion Torrent S5 and Illumina MiSeq success rates of 96% and 94%, respectively. The study focused on genomic coverage (above 80%) and mutation detection (below 100), with the Ion Torrent S5 achieving 99% coverage compared to Illumina MiSeq's 80%, likely due to different primers used in amplification. The Ion Torrent S5 was more effective in sequencing varied viral loads, whereas Illumina MiSeq had difficulties with lower loads. Both platforms were adept at identifying clades, successfully differentiating between Beta (<45%) and Delta variants (<30%), despite minor discrepancies in assignments due to Illumina MiSeq's lower coverage, leading to a failure rate of up to 6%. Manual library preparation showed similar sample processing and clade identification capabilities for both platforms. However, differences in sequencing duration (3.5 vs. 36 hours), automation level, genomic coverage (80% vs. 99%), and viral load compatibility were noted, highlighting each platform's unique advantages and challenges in SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance. In conclusion, the Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent S5 platforms are both efficacious in executing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) via amplicons, facilitating precise, accurate, and high-throughput examinations of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes. However, it is important to note the existence of disparities in the quality of data produced by each platform. Each system offers unique benefits and limitations, rendering them viable choices for the genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "title": "Bacteriologically Derived Copper Nanoparticles as Novel Arsenal Against Multidrug-Resistant Pathogens.",
    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a global health menace which has caused millions of deaths and still continues to grow. The announcement of <i>World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, 18-24 November 2022</i> by WHO further highlights the terrifying situation. Injudicious use of antibiotics is the major cause of emerging AMR. Therefore, new age antimicrobials are required for treating multi drug resistant (MDR) infections. In this quest, we synthesized novel green copper nanoparticles (BS-CuNPs) using cell free extracts of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> (MTCC 441) and tested their bactericidal potential against various MDR pathogenic bacteria viz <i>Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, E. coli</i> Anp2A, <i>E. coli</i> Bi2A, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> VTCCBAA2, <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> Bu59. Antioxidant properties were also investigated using the DPPH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> radical scavenging techniques in terms of IC<sub>50</sub> (concentrations required for 50% inhibition) and IC<sub>90</sub> (concentrations required for 90% inhibition) values. The TEM micrographs of bacteriologically synthesized BS-CuNPs displayed size of 11.47 ± 2.6 nm with spherical configuration. BS-CuNPs also showed excellent colloidal and thermal stability in terms of zeta potential (- 26.9 meV) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The MICs and MBCs of the BS-CuNPs against test MDR bacteria were ≤ 0.625 mg/ml which was significantly lesser (<i>p</i> < 0.05) than the same exhibited by CuNPs. The strongest effects were seen on <i>Enterobacter cloacae Bu59</i> with MIC values of 0.156 mg/ml. The IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>90</sub> of BS-CuNPs in DPPH assay exhibited significantly lower values, i.e. 42.97 and 128.31 µg/ml, respectively as compared to the chemically synthesized CuNPs, indicating potent antioxidant activity. These results from the performed studies clearly demonstrate the potential use of biogenic BS-CuNPs as novel antimicrobial in the field of biomedicine.

    "abstract": "To study the characteristics of ophthalmic comorbidities in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. We assessed the clinical and epidemiological attributes and characteristics of ophthalmic comorbidities of patients who had chronic plaque psoriasis for 15-25 years (mean ± standard deviation [SD], 3.9 ± 4.8 years). Out of 100 patients, 57 were males and 43 were females. In this cohort, the age range was from 19 to 77 years (mean ± SD, 41.8 ± 13.9 years). The severity of psoriasis was defined by the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) score as mild (PASI ≤6), moderate (PASI >6-12), or severe (PASI >12). Psoriasis was mild in 77, moderate in 13, and severe in 10 patients, respectively. Three patients had asymmetric oligoarthritis. In a cohort of 100 patients, there were 23 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and 77 patients with mild psoriasis. In the moderate-to-severe psoriasis group, 18 out of the 23 patients also had ophthalmic abnormalities. In the mild psoriasis group, 53 of 77 patients also had ophthalmic abnormalities. Itching (<i>n</i> = 12; psoriasis was mild in 7, moderate-to-severe in 5 patients), decreased vision (<i>n</i> = 12; psoriasis was mild in 10, moderate-to-severe in 2 patients), redness (<i>n</i> = 9; psoriasis was mild in 5, moderate-to-severe in 5 patients;), watering/discharge (<i>n</i> = 8; psoriasis was mild in 6, moderate-to-severe in 2 patients), and pain or burning (<i>n</i> = 6; psoriasis was mild in 4, moderate-to-severe in 2 patients) were commonly complained by 31 patients. The major ophthalmic comorbidities in order of frequency observed were keratoconjunctivitis sicca/dry eye (<i>n</i> = 41), blepharitis (<i>n =</i> 29), meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) (<i>n =</i> 18), conjunctivitis (<i>n =</i> 10), corneal abnormalities (<i>n =</i> 13), cataract (<i>n =</i> 14), retention cyst (<i>n =</i> 2), and anterior uveitis in 2 patients (without psoriatic arthritis). Common corneal abnormalities were punctuate keratitis (<i>n =</i> 7), corneal opacities (<i>n =</i> 4), band-shaped keratopathy (<i>n =</i> 1), and superficial vascularization (<i>n =</i> 1). Posterior segment manifestations of arteriosclerotic changes (<i>n</i> = 4), media haze (<i>n</i> = 2), and macular degeneration (<i>n</i> = 1) were likely to be age-related. The ophthalmic comorbidities, such as blepharitis, MGD, conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, corneal abnormalities, and presenile cataract, can occur in patients with psoriasis. These are largely asymptomatic and subtle findings that are often missed. They require an early consult to ophthalmology for appropriate management. The major limitations in this study are that it is a single-center, cross-sectional study design that has a low number of patients, lacks a healthy patient control group, and there is a lack of long-term follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Modification of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport dynamics is an expanding method for treating central nervous system injury and diseases. One application of this route is to modify the distribution of solutes in the CSF; however, few tools currently exist for this purpose. The present study describes the use of a subject-specific in vitro CSF phantom to perform a parametric evaluation of the Neurapheresis™ CSF Management System (NP) for both CSF filtration and intrathecal drug circulation. An in vitro CSF phantom was constructed which included realistic anatomy for the complete subarachnoid space (SAS). This platform was configured to test multiple parametric modifications of a dual-lumen catheter and filtration system. Calibrated mapping of tracer distribution and area under the curve (AUC) measurements were used to compare filtration and intrathecal-circulation schemes using the NP device versus the clinical standards of care. The NP device showed potential advantages over lumbar drain (LD) for clearance of simulated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), especially in the spinal canal. Use of the NP device in combination with simulated intracerebroventricular (ICV) drug infusion resulted in an increased extent and uniformity of tracer spread compared to ICV alone. NP improved clearance of simulated subarachnoid hemorrhage compared to LD and increased uniformity of tracer concentration via simulated ICV, providing support for NP use in these scenarios. The in vitro CSF phantom system presented here quantitatively described the effects of parametric boundary modification on solute distribution in the intrathecal space.",

    "abstract": "Upper limb prosthetics aim to restore function and aesthetics of a lost arm and/or hand, which affects a growing population. A \"Golden Period,\" the first month after the amputation, has been identified as the optimal time when a prosthesis should be fitted to amputees to maximize their chances for a fast and successful return to their daily life. This time window is often surpassed because of delays in approvals by health insurance companies and time requirements for producing personally customized and costly sockets. This study aims to develop an adaptable and versatile temporary transradial socket design capable of multidimensional adjustments and easy user fitting to better capitalize on the \"Golden Period\" and allow for early prosthetic training. In addition, the socket should be useable within research in need for flexible prosthesis as well as a hybrid prosthesis within the context of bionic reconstruction. The socket was designed, 3D printed, and assembled as a wearable prototype, hosting all relevant myoelectric hand components. The estimated satisfaction with the socket was evaluated in a monocentric, explorative study with both, prosthetic users and experts in the field. The proposed design is able to change its diameter and length. Moreover, according to the conducted survey, it is perceived as satisfactory with respect to both user needs and expectations of the experts. \"Weight,\" \"ease in donning and doffing,\" and \"breathability\" were rated particularly well, whereas an improved, more versatile, and smaller design is needed for broad clinical use.",

    "title": "Sweetened Areca Nut, A Risk in Dental Caries among Adolescents in Pune, Maharashtra? A Case-Control Study.",
    "abstract": "Smokeless tobacco (SLT) causes dental caries and so does chewing of areca nut (sweetened supari) due to the presence of sugar. Since conflicting views exist about whether areca nut causes dental caries or not, and since studies are undertaken in adults and data on adolescents are not available, this study was carried out. Since those were cross-sectional or longitudinal studies, this case-control study was undertaken to understand if flavored/sweetened areca nut is a risk factor for dental caries. This unmatched case-control study was conducted among the male students of 8<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> standard in the age group of 12-16 of four Madhyamik Vidyalaya's (MVs) in Pimpri-Chinchwad (urban area), Pune. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was drawn to determine the independent variables to be selected for the study and minimal variables to be adjusted during data analysis. Selection of cases was based on diagnostic and eligibility criteria. The data on the use of sweetened areca nuts and the presence of caries were collected through oral examination and a semistructured questionnaire administered by the principal investigator on a one-to-one basis between August 2022 and October 2022. Data were analyzed using epiinfo<sup>TM</sup> 7.2.5.0. This study of 146 males in the age group of 13 to 16 years had 61 students as cases and 85 as controls. No significant difference was observed between the group with (cases) and without (controls) dental caries for areca nut use (pack years) whether consumed daily or less frequently for 1 year or more. While the exposure rate to areca nut among cases was 44.26%, for the control group it was 36.47%. The odds ratio of sweetened areca nut as being the risk factor for dental caries was 1.38 at 95% CI (0.70-2.71) with <i>P</i> = 0.44. This study revealed that the adolescent users of sweetened areca nuts studying in government schools had a higher exposure odds ratio for dental caries. However, it was not significant statistically. Information bias including recall may have influenced the outcome.",

An online survey was completed by caregivers who had children with and without intellectual disability during Time Period 1 (T1; August-December 2021, <i>n</i> = 171) and then again during Time Period 2 (T2; January-March 2022, <i>n</i> = 109). Child behaviours that challenge and caregiver psychological distress reduced in T2 compared to T1. Child behaviours that challenge, emotion focussed coping and avoidant coping was associated distress at both time points in caregivers of children with and without intellectual disabilities. The study shows that both child behaviours that challenge and caregiver psychological distress reduced as lockdown ended. However, caregiver coping strategies may have contributed to psychological distress, which has potential implications for interventions and support for caregivers.",

    "title": "Fragmenting any Parallelepiped into a Signed Tiling.",
    "abstract": "It is broadly known that any parallelepiped tiles space by translating copies of itself along its edges. In earlier work relating to higher-dimensional sandpile groups, the second author discovered a novel construction which fragments the parallelepiped into a collection of smaller tiles. These tiles fill space with the same symmetry as the larger parallelepiped. Their volumes are equal to the components of the multi-row Laplace determinant expansion, so this construction only works when all of these signs are non-negative (or non-positive). In this work, we extend the construction to work for all parallelepipeds, without requiring the non-negative condition. This naturally gives tiles with negative volume, which we understand to mean canceling out tiles with positive volume. In fact, with this cancellation, we prove that every point in space is contained in exactly one more tile with positive volume than tile with negative volume. This is a natural definition for a signed tiling. Our main technique is to show that the net number of signed tiles doesn't change as a point moves through space. This is a relatively indirect proof method, and the underlying structure of these tilings remains mysterious.",

    "title": "Exploring In-Silico Immunoepitope Landscape and Genetic Diversity in p72 and CD2v Proteins Across Asian African Swine Fever Virus Isolates.",
    "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) is a highly lethal infectious disease affecting pigs caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The p72 is the major capsid protein and has strong immunogenicity. Another, outer envelope protein, CD2-like (CD2v), plays a pivotal role in viral pathogenesis. Despite the grave threat posed by ASFV, efficient vaccines and diagnostic assays remain elusive. In this study, genetic diversity of p72 and CD2v at protein and gene levels was analysed in-silico among most of the isolates of ASFV across Asia, including India, by assessing sequence similarity, phylogeny, and selection pressure. Further, in-silico prediction of immunogenic epitopes was done within stabilized (by MD-simulation) predicted structures of p72 and CD2v proteins by assessing variability in terms of Shannon entropy, relative solvent accessibility, and prediction of B and T-cell epitope peptides. The present study highlights the conservation of both p72 and CD2v proteins across prevalent ASFV isolates in Asia, including India, and suggests for their potential utility in developing diagnostic assays, as both can induce robust immunogenic responses. Consequently, these proteins emerge as promising vaccine candidates against ASFV. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12088-024-01305-7.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective cross-sectional description was conducted to investigate co-infection rates of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> (Gonorrhea) and <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> (Chlamydia) in patients from Northern Vietnam who visited the Central Dermatology Hospital during 2016-2019 and the factors including gender, age, location, and season that may relate to the co-infection rates. Data of hospital routine diagnostics using rapid tests for chlamydia and Gram staining for gonorrhea for patients with vaginal or urethral discharge syndrome were analysed. Real-time PCR was used to confirm the positive samples. During the 4 year study period, 5937 (0.74%) cases of either mono- or co-infections of gonorrhea and chlamydia were detected among 795,599 visiting patients. Of these cases, 2427 (41.36%) were diagnosed with gonorrhea, 3474 (57.99%) with chlamydia, and 36 (0.65%) with co-infections of gonorrhea and chlamydia. The co-infection rate in women was 4.8-fold higher than that in men (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and in Hanoi capital, it was 2.3-fold higher than in all other regions in Northern Vietnam (<i>p</i> = 0.018). In terms of seasonality, the highest and lowest co-infection rates were observed in summer (33.33%) and winter (19.41%), respectively. In conclusion, the prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia co-infections was comparatively low, with a predominance in women as compared to men, in Hanoi capital than in the remaining areas of Northern Vietnam. Additionally, a higher frequency was observed during the summer season. The data obtained is important in controlling the rate of gonorrhea and chlamydia in Vietnam and contributes valuable insights to the global and Asian epidemic mapping of these infections.

    "title": "Feminist Identity and Online Activism in Four Countries From 2019 to 2023.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic heightened burdens on caregivers, but also the visibility of caregiving inequalities. These grievances may activate a feminist identity which in turn leads to greater civic and political participation. During a pandemic, online forms of participation are particularly attractive as they require less effort than offline forms of participation and pose less health risks compared to collective forms of offline activism. Using survey data from four countries (Canada, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom) collected in 2019 (prior to the pandemic), 2021 (during the pandemic), and 2023 (post-pandemic), we examine the relationship between self-identifying as a feminist and signing online petitions (<i>n</i> = 18,362). Our multivariate analyses show that having a feminist identity is positively related to signing online petitions. We consider the differential effects of this identity on participation for men, women, non-binary people; caregivers versus non-caregivers; and respondents in different countries with varying levels of restrictions due to the pandemic. A feminist identity is more important for mobilizing caregivers than non-caregivers, whether or not the caregiver is a man or a woman. While grievance theory suggests differential effects by country and time period, we find a consistent role of feminist identity in predicting the signing of online petitions across time and across countries. These findings offer insights into how different groups in varying contexts are mobilized to participate.",

    "abstract": "There are increased efforts to promote gender diversity in skull base specialties. This study seeks to evaluate changes within neurotology, rhinology, and skull base neurosurgery (SBNS) over the past decade. Information regarding fellows training in the past 10 years, current faculty members and fellowship directors, and grants and awards were extracted from the American Neurotology Society, American Rhinologic Society, and North American Skull Base Society Web sites, tabulated, and summarized. Chi-square analysis compared the proportional makeup of female fellows within related fields. In the past decade in neurotology, men constituted 89 of 128 (69.53%) fellows, 132 of 170 (77.64%) faculty members, and 25 of 29 (86.2%) fellowship directors. Within rhinology, men constituted 211 of 279 (75.63%) fellows, 113 of 141 (80.14%) faculty members, and 32 of 35 (91.4%) fellowship directors. In SBNS programs, men constituted 94 of 105 (90%) fellows, 120 of 133 (90%) faculty members, and 43 of 44 (97.73%) fellowship directors. In neurotology fellowships, the proportion of women increased (12%, <i>p</i>  = 0.06) from 2012-2017 to 2018-2022. Similarly, SBNS and rhinology had statistically insignificant increases of 4.28% ( <i>p</i>  = 0.86) and 8.70% ( <i>p</i>  = 0.87). The representation of women is consistent across all three skull base specialties. Although the overall number of women in each field is increasing, it changes slowly. The gender makeup across all three skull base specialties is similar.",

    "abstract": "Histamine, a critical regulator of attention and inflammatory processes, may play a role in symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Data were from the baseline visit of a multi-site randomized controlled trial in children aged 6-12 with symptoms of ADHD and emotional dysregulation, the Micronutrients for ADHD in Youth (MADDY) study. Parent-reported intake of high-histamine foods was assessed with the VioScreen questionnaire; symptoms of ADHD with the Child & Adolescent Symptom Inventory, version-5 (CASI-5) Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales, and emotional dysregulation with the Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire-Dysregulation Profile. Urinary histamine was analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, with reference ranges for children < 10 and 10-12 years old. Thirty percent of children < 10 years old and 81% of children 10-12 (57% overall) had urinary histamine levels above the upper limit of the reference range. Urinary histamine was not associated with inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, or emotional dysregulation, nor intake of high-histamine foods, in the entire sample (<i>N</i> = 83). In a sensitivity analysis, participants with urinary histamine levels above the reference range had inattention scores 0.26 points higher on the CASI-5 than participants within the reference range (<i>β</i> = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.52; <i>p</i> = 0.043). In this secondary data analysis, urinary histamine levels were not associated with severity of hyperactivity/impulsivity or emotional dysregulation, or intake of high-histamine foods. Children with high urinary histamine had increased inattention compared to those with normal histamine levels. Limitations include the homogeneity of the sample and the lack of a comparison group without ADHD.",

    "abstract": "This study used the National Taiwan Health Insurance database, including prescribed medications, underlying systemic diseases, and surgical types, to evaluate the relationship between those factors and mortality after general anesthesia. This retrospective, population-based study was retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013. We proposed a logistic regression model that can significantly predict postanesthesia mortality, which was validated in another set of databases. Moreover, we subgroup the study population into four major comparison groups, which include major organ transplantation, cardiovascular (CV) surgery, major neurosurgery, and others according to the diagnostic codes of the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification codes. A total of 681,779 subjects were analyzed in this study, and the most common comorbidity was hypertension. Age was an important determinant associated with postoperative mortality among different surgical types. Perioperative prescription could reduce the risks of the operation. The major surgeries (major organ transplantation, CV surgery, and neurosurgery) were associated with increasing postoperative mortality. The prediction model performed well in the validation group (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.8753 for in-hospital mortality; AUROC = 0.8767 for 30-day mortality). The prediction model that we proposed from this nationwide study could identify the predictors for postoperative mortality. The potentially protective effects of anti-lipid, hypoglycemic, and anti-hypertensive agents were encouraging in the geriatric preoperative group. It is expected that applying this prediction model and prescription into clinical practice could improve surgical risk stratification and further improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "With the rising prevalence of mental health disorders, it is important to consider their correlation with surgical outcomes. Anxiety has been associated with adverse events after many surgical procedures, but its relationship relative to anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) regarding medical complications has not previously been assessed in a large database study. The 2010-Q3 2022 PearlDiver Mariner161 database was used to identify patients undergoing single-level ACDF. Those with versus without preoperative anxiety were matched 1:1 based on age, sex, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Rates of 90-day adverse events were compared by multivariate regression analyses, and 5-year cervical revision surgery rates were compared. Of 287,278 ACDF patients, preoperative anxiety was identified for 36.73%. After matching, patients with anxiety had greater odds ratios of all assessed individual 90-day adverse outcomes, as well as any (OR: 3.09), severe (OR: 2.07), and minor (OR: 3.39) adverse events (P < 0.0001 for all). Those with preoperative anxiety had slightly greater 5-year rates of subsequent cervical spine surgery than those without (P < 0.0001, at 5 years 12.9% versus 11.7%). ACDF patients with a history of anxiety had higher odds of many 90-day adverse outcomes and slightly higher 5-year revision surgery rates. These findings may inform patient counseling and risk management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) incidence in Northeastern Thailand is very high and a major cause of mortality. CCA patients typically have a poor prognosis and short-term survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to approve medicinal cannabis treatment, especially for palliative care with advanced cancer patients. A retrospective cohort study compared survival among 491 newly diagnosed advanced CCA patients between September 2019 and June 2021. Of these, 404 received standard palliative pain management (ST), and 87 received medicinal cannabis treatment (CT). Patients were enrolled from four tertiary hospitals and two secondary hospitals in five provinces of Northeast Thailand. Cumulative survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox regression. For ST patients, follow-up time was 790 person-months, with a mortality rate of 48.35/100 person-months. For CT patients, follow-up time was 476 person-months, with a mortality rate of 10.9/100 person-months. The median survival time after registration at a palliative clinic was 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71-0.95) for ST and 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94-9.38) for CT. Multivariate analysis showed CT was significantly associated with prolonged survival (HRadj = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.20-0.37; p < 0.001). The medical cannabis increased overall survival rates among CCA patients. In this retrospective cohort, Medicinal cannabis treatment was associated with more prolonged survival among advanced CCA patients in Northeastern Thailand. While this association remained significant after multivariable adjustment, unmeasured or residual confounding factors may have influenced the observed outcomes. Although the association remained significant after adjustment, unmeasured or residual confounders may have influenced outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore potential mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Current available plastic surgery positions in craniofacial surgery are not commensurate with the growing number of trained plastic surgery residents and fellows interested in the field. Despite this, there is growing demand for surgery in other areas of the craniofacial field, such as facial gender-affirming surgery (GAS), in which academic plastic surgery programs can increase resident and fellow case exposure. The present study sought to characterize the increase in craniofacial surgery exposure with the introduction of a GAS rotation among plastic surgery residents at one academic medical center. A single-center retrospective review of ten plastic surgery resident case logs between 2013 and 2021 was carried out. Case logs were evaluated for case frequency per year in craniofacial surgery and breast reconstruction surgery, which was used as a control. Case frequency was compared before and after the introduction of the GAS rotation in 2017. Craniofacial surgery exposure increased from an average of 26 to 45 cases per resident per year after the introduction of a GAS rotation and overall increased from 17 to 29 cases per year. The average breast reconstruction caseload remained similar at the same time, from an average of 37 to 36 cases per year per resident. The introduction of a GAS rotation at one institution increased craniofacial surgery exposure for plastic surgery residents. Increasing craniofacial surgery exposure is crucial in the competitive landscape for job opportunities, further increasing resident exposure to the transgender and gender-diverse population, and expanding care for this patient population.",

    "abstract": "The Kacang goat ( <i>Capra hircus</i>) is an indigenous livestock species in Indonesia that is at risk of extinction due to cross-breeding. Artificial insemination (AI) techniques are expected to increase the population of these goats. This study aimed to determine the addition of epigallocatechin-3-gallate chitosan nanoparticles (EGCG CNPs) to skim milk-egg yolk (SM-EY) extender to obtain the best possible quality of post-thawed Kacang buck semen for AI. Fresh Kacang buck semen was diluted in SM-EY without or with the addition of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 µg of EGCG CNPs/mL extender. Extended semen was packaged in French mini straws, frooze, and stored in liquid nitrogen at -196℃ for 24 hours. Six replicates from each treatment group were thawed for catalase, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, malondialdehyde (MDA), sperm intact plasma membrane (MPI), living cells and motility analyses. Post-thawed semen that was previously frozen without EGCG CNPs in the extender (control group) exhibited the lowest levels of catalase, DPPH, sperm viability, sperm motility, IPM, and the highest levels of MDA. However, the addition of EGCG CNPs at doses of 1.5 µg/mL extender increased post-thawed catalase, DPPH, sperm IPM, viability, and sperm motility and decreased MDA levels (p < 0.05) than those of control group. This study was the first in which EGCG CNPs were used in SM-EY extender, and the addition of only 1.0 µg/mL of EGCG CNPs in this extender increased the antioxidant capacity and post-thawed quality of Kacang buck semen.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) and all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. 371 MHD patients were included in this retrospective study. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of SIRI. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the median SIRI value. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare the difference in survival rate. Cox regression analysis was used to analyze all-cause and CVD mortality risk factors, and nomograms were developed. The average age of the patients was 60.71 ±15.34 years, and the median follow-up was 42 months. 157 patients died. SIRI had predictive value for all-cause and CVD mortality. The AUC of the SIRI to predict all-cause mortality was 0.698, 0.664, 0.713, and 0.900 at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. For CVD mortality, the AUC of the SIRI was 0.678, 0.667, 0.717, and 0.906 at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high SIRI values had a significantly lower survival rate. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that SIRI > 1.88 was an independent risk factor for all-cause and CVD mortality. SIRI can independently predict all-cause and CVD mortality in MHD patients, which has important value for prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) presents a significant challenge among autoimmune diseases, affecting millions globally with diverse clinical manifestations, primarily targeting joints and inducing inflammation, pain, and deformities. In some cases, it leads to the formation of Bakers cysts, fluid-filled bursae in the popliteal region, resulting from chronic inflammation of the synovial membrane and subsequent pannus growth. Our case, a young female patient with RA, presenting with calf mass, highlights this complex interplay. She presented with large swelling and pain in her left calf region which on high-frequency ultrasound revealed a large, well-defined heteroechoic mass lesion distending bursa between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and semimembranosus muscle, measuring 25 cm craniocaudally, without any color Doppler abnormality. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed to rule out the possibility of sarcoma and it revealed inflammatory changes. Final diagnosis of excessive pannus formation within the Baker's cyst forming large mass was made, with RA identified as the underlying cause. The differential diagnosis of masses in the popliteal fossa includes synovial/meniscal/ganglion cysts, lipomas, vascular pathologies, and neoplastic conditions. High-resolution ultrasound is an important diagnostic modality for evaluating popliteal fossa masses. Magnetic resonance imaging is typically performed to assess for neoplastic causes and internal derangement of the knee. Our case of a massive pannus filling a Baker's cyst in the context of RA emphasizes the intricate nature of the disease and its diverse clinical expressions. It is important for the radiologist to be aware of this imaging appearance for timely diagnosis and management.",

    "title": "Progressive Moral Foundations and Empathic Concern: Facilitators of Sexual Assault Bystander Intervention.",
    "abstract": "Many universities utilize bystander intervention training to address high rates of sexual assault on college campuses. To that end, research has long sought to characterize common barriers to bystander intervention to inform future programming efforts. However, recent efforts have also noted the importance of understanding intervention <i>facilitators</i>, or factors that encourage someone to help in risk situations. For example, a moral obligation to \"step in\" has been highlighted as a potential facilitator among college students who have intervened in sexual risk situations. Higher levels of empathy are also noted as encouraging prosocial intervention behaviors. Yet, what remains to be examined is the possibility that a greater combination of progressive moral foundations and empathic concern may favorably impact perceptions of barriers and behaviors as related to sexual assault bystander intervention. The current study tested this hypothesis in a sample of 1,144 undergraduate students who completed self-report assessments related to moral foundations, empathy, and perceptions of barriers and proactive behaviors in light of sexual assault risk. A series of moderation analyses revealed those who endorsed a greater combination of progressive moral foundations and empathic concern reported less perceived barriers and increased engagement in sexual assault bystander intervention behaviors. By contrast, those with lower empathy reported greater barriers and less intervention behaviors even in the presence of progressive moral foundations. Should these virtues be modifiable as research suggests, activities enhancing progressive moral foundations and empathic concern may be important additions to bystander intervention programming on college campuses.",

    "title": "Mycogenic Fabrication of Zinc Nanoparticles for Their Antifungal Activity Against <i>Alternaria mali</i>.",
    "abstract": "Synthesis of nanoparticles through environmentally friendly and biologically mediated routes is the study upon which lot of research attention has been focused in recent times. In the present investigation, fungal-mediated synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles was explored using an economical and nature friendly approach. Synthesis of the extracellular zinc oxide nanoparticles was achieved using fungal cultures of <i>Pleurotus, Lentinus</i> and <i>Agaricus</i> spp. The synthesized nanomaterial was thoroughly characterized using physical techniques including UV-Vis Spectroscopy, SEM, XRD, and FTIR. UV-Vis Spectroscopy exposed a distinct absorption peak in the range of 300-400 nm, validating the formation of nanoparticles. SEM images revealed the ZnNPs being agglomerated and irregular in shape. The size of the particles is in the average range of 10-100 nm. XRD analysis demonstrated the nature of the nanoparticles as crystalline, with prominent diffraction peaks corresponding to the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure of zinc oxide. FTIR analysis provided insights into the functional groups present on the nanoparticle surface. This suggests that there is some involvement of fungal biomolecules in the reduction and stabilization of zinc oxide nanoparticles. The presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles was confirmed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis. Furthermore, the synthesized nanoparticles were assessed for their potential antifungal activity against <i>Alternaria mali</i>, a notorious phytopathogen responsible for causing leaf spot in Apple plant. The antifungal activity was assessed through poison food technique and results indicated a significant inhibition of <i>Alternaria</i> growth by the zinc oxide nanoparticles particularly the ones synthesized from <i>Pleurotus</i>, with a dose-dependent response. The mycogenic synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles is an eco-friendly and sustainable approach, minimizing the need for hazardous chemicals and reducing environmental impact. This study showcases the potential of zinc oxide nanoparticles as a novel and effective biofungicide against <i>Alternaria mali</i> and contributes to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable methods of nanoparticle synthesis and their applications in agriculture (disease management) and environmental management.",

    "abstract": "The digitalization process and the constant and prolonged use of digital technologies can lead to the development of digital stress, defined with the term technostress. This type of stress is related to the relationship between individuals and digital technologies and can lead to some related drifts, such as techno-anxiety and techno-addiction, concerning states of anxiety, apprehension, fear, or addiction toward digital technologies. Thus, it is crucial to avoid and lessen the potential development of technostress, particularly in the current historical age that has expanded the number of smart workers in constant touch with various digital technologies. This contribution highlights the potential applications of multi-integrated neuroscientific protocols to assess how technology can influence interpersonal dynamics and relational mechanisms, through the lenses of neuroassessment procedures; and to promote better emotional regulation and stress reduction through neuroempowerment protocols aimed at the reduction of technostress at the physiological level.",

    "abstract": "Around 300 cases of stigma have been described since the 13th century. Hematidrosis, hemolacria, bloody otorrhea, vicarious menstruation, and Gardner-Diamond syndrome are dermatological manifestations that are also observed in cases of stigma. This paper presents the disconcerting circumstances in the life of the Blessed Elena Aiello. From 1923 until her death, she suffered severe hematidrosis blood sweating on her forehead, hands, feet and knees, just as stigmata appear at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Stigmas, in Christian tradition, are marks corresponding to those left on Christ's body by the torture and the Crucifixion, it's said that are impressed on the person body by divine favor. These episodes, among the few recognised as authentic by the Catholic Church would appear each Friday in Lent, particularly on Good Friday. In this unique case study, doctors Fabrizio and Turano performed a medical study where the origin of the sores was unclear. Neurologist and psychiatrist Vincenzo Bianchi, on assessing the case, raised the possibility of simulation or mere suggestion on the part of the patient.",

Association of condylar changes with TMD diagnosis, missing teeth and rheumatic diseases was analysed using Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confident intervals (CI) were estimated using a binary logistic regression model. Most common condylar change was flattening (32.8%). Associations were found between unilaterally flattened condyle and myalgia and arthralgia. No statistically significant associations were found between condylar changes and missing teeth or missing molars. Erosive and deform changes in condyles were associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Condylar changes in DPTs were not associated with TMD diagnosis or missing teeth among 46-year-old study population.

Retrospective cohort study with workers at a sugar-ethanol plant in the region of Dracena, SP, Brazil. The reference and sequential audiological exams were compared. The outcome dependent variable was the presence of hearing loss and the independent variables were age, environmental sound pressure level, type of workplace and presence of diabetes mellitus. 547 workers were evaluated. The univariate assessment showed a chance of finding individuals older than 39 years old with hearing loss triggering was 4.25 times greater compared to individuals aged between 19 and 28 years. The presence of diabetes increases the chance of hearing loss when compared to individuals without the disease. In the multivariate model, when adjusting for the predictors, there was a reduction in the chance of having diabetes, since part of the observed effect would be linked to the age. There is an association between diabetes mellitus and onset of hearing loss in individuals exposed to occupational noise below 85 dB.",

    "abstract": "Chronically implanting microelectrodes for high-resolution action potential recording is critical for understanding the brain. The smallest and most flexible electrodes, most suitable for chronic recordings, are also the most difficult to insert due to buckling against the thin but hard-to-penetrate brain meninges. To address such implantation challenges without introducing further damage to the brain, this paper presents our design and prototype of an inchworm-type insertion device that conducts a grip-feed-release incremental motion for planar microelectrode insertion. To optimize the operating parameters of the developed inchworm insertion device, experimental studies were conducted on the polyvinyl chloride-based brain-mimicking phantom to investigate the effects of (1) incremental insertion depth, (2) inserter drive shaft rotary speed, and (3) the resulting inchworm insertion speed, on the phantom (1) penetration rupture force and (2) dimpling depth at rupture. Analysis showed that all three factors had a statistically significant impact on the rupture force and dimpling depth. A moderate level of the resulting insertion speed yielded the lowest rupture force and dimpling depth at rupture. Low insertion speed levels were associated with higher rupture force while high insertion speeds led to a large variance in dimpling depth and potential insertion failure. To achieve such a moderate insertion speed, it would be preferred for both the incremental insertion depth and the drive shaft rotary speed to be at a moderate level. Such findings lay the foundation for enabling previously impossible buckling-free insertion of miniaturized flexible planar microelectrodes deep into the brain.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and accurate emotion recognition is a crucial skill for social interactions, and visual attention to informative social cues in the environment can facilitate emotion recognition. Studies have found that emotion recognition is also associated with underlying cardiac autonomic responses. The current study examined (1) visual attention and cardiac response (change in heart rate) to emotionally-expressive faces and houses (as a nonsocial control image), and (2) associations between these responses and emotion recognition on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) in college students. Results showed increased overall attention, but shorter first fixation durations, to faces as compared to houses. Across faces, attention was greater to eyes than mouth, but the magnitude of this difference was dependent on emotion. Analysis of cardiac responses revealed greater heart rate deceleration to happy and fearful faces as compared to neutral faces and houses. Better emotion recognition accuracy on the RMET was related to greater attention to faces, and eyes specifically, as well as greater heart rate deceleration to faces relative to houses. No relations between visual attention and cardiac response were found. The current work points to variations in visual attention and cardiac response while viewing emotional faces that can be markers of emotion processing ability.",

    "title": "The Partners of My Partners: Shared Collaborative Experience and Team Performance in Surgical Teams.",
    "abstract": "When teams in organizations are assembled to perform contingent tasks, team members carry with them experiences of prior interaction with partners in different teams. Focal team members share collaborative experiences to the extent that they worked with common external prior partners. Extending current research on team effectiveness, we investigate how shared collaborative experience (SCE) affects team performance. Consistent with the established understanding of team processes as carrying both a teamwork and a taskwork component, we conceptualize SCE as having two distinct dimensions that we call SCE extent and SCE diversity. We posit that high SCE extent increases the ability of teams to refine their teamwork processes, increasing their performance through enhanced coordination and reflexivity. We argue that high SCE diversity hinders the ability of teams to form a shared understanding of task demands, thus undermining team performance. Furthermore, we investigate the contingent effect of task complexity on the relationship between SCE and performance. We argue that the benefits of implicit coordination and the drawbacks of experience diversity decrease as tasks become more complex and require more explicit coordination and wider repertoires of responses. These predictions find support in an analysis of 1343 robot-assisted surgery operations performed by 114 surgeons during a four-year period in a private university hospital. By explicitly recognizing how team members benefit from the network of their shared prior partners, our study contributes to developing a new approach to study the effectiveness of temporary teams in organizations.",

    "abstract": "Grazing, defined as the unplanned and repetitive consumption of small or moderate amounts of food without feeling hungry, has been particulary investigated in relation to insufficient weight loss or early weight regain following bariatric surgery in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Turkish form of the Repetitive Eating Scale (Rep[eat]-Q), which assesses grazing within a standardized framework. The sample of the study consisted of a total of 491 adults, including 334 females and 157 males, with ages ranging from 17 to 62 participated in the study. The data were collected using the Rep[eat]-Q Turkish Form, Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21), CES-D Depression Scale (CES-D), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). Results of the confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the structure of the Rep[eat]-Q Turkish Form aligns with the original form, indicating that the scale consists of two factors named Compulsive Grazing (CG) and Repetitive Eating (RE). The internal consistency coefficients were found to be 0.93 for the total scale score, 0.91 for the RE subscale, and 0.88 for the CG subscale. The test-retest reliability ranged from 0.73 to 0.83 (p<0.001). It was found that the total score of the Rep(eat)-Q is strongly positively correlated with Emotional Eating and Uncontrolled Eating subscales of the TFEQ-R21, and moderately positively correlated with the CES-D (depression) and the GAD-7 (anxiety). The findings of the study demonstrated that the Turkish version of the Rep(eat)-Q is a reliable and valid measure to assess grazing.",

    "abstract": "Transnasal skull base surgery is a complex and invasive procedure that involves the use of preoperative antiseptic preparations. However, evidence supporting their use in preventing postoperative infectious complications is limited. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of preoperative antiseptic techniques in reducing postoperative infectious complications within 30 days of surgery. A multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind, three-arm trial was conducted from February 2019 to October 2021. Participants were randomized to either of three antiseptic preparation techniques: external 0.9% NaCl nasal preparation, external 0.05% chlorhexidine gluconate, or intranasal irrigation with 80 mg of gentamicin added to 1,000 mL of 0.9% NaCl plus external nasal preparation with chlorhexidine gluconate 0.05%. A total of 130 adults with skull base pathologies were randomized; 12 were excluded before randomization for failure to meet the inclusion criteria ( <i>n</i>  = 9) or refusal to participate ( <i>n</i>  = 3). We excluded patients with evidence of infection adjacent to the surgical site, allergies to preparation methods, those who underwent craniotomy during the same admission, and pediatric patients. The mean age of the participants was 43.26 ± 14.45 years. Nine patients developed postoperative infections (meningitis, <i>n</i>  = 8; sinusitis, <i>n</i>  = 2). Among the factors studied, length of surgery ( <i>p</i>  = 0.002), perioperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion ( <i>p</i>  = 0.01), chordoma ( <i>p</i>  = 0.004), extended approach ( <i>p</i>  = 0.026), and postoperative CSF leak ( <i>p</i>  = 0.025) were significantly associated with postoperative infections. There were no clinically meaningful or significant differences in the studied intervention groups regarding postoperative infectious complications. Preoperative antiseptic techniques failed to prefer one application to prevent postoperative infectious complications in patients who underwent endoscopic transnasal skull base surgery.",

    "abstract": "Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a genetically heterogenous disorder. We conducted this pilot study to explore the possibility of genetic discovery in patients with VUR using exome sequencing. Whole exome sequencing was performed on the DNA of ten Indian children (nine boys) with bilateral grade IV/V reflux and bilateral renal hypodysplasia (extreme phenotype) as well as that of a family with 2 affected male siblings with bilateral VUR and chronic kidney disease. For prioritization of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the ten children with extreme phenotype, extremely rare and deleterious variations were selected from a list of 778 genes of biological relevance. Hypothesis-free prioritization was performed in the VUR family. Copy-number variations (CNV) were also called and prioritized from whole exome data. Among ten patients with extreme phenotype, rare and novel and deleterious variants related to VUR and renal hypodysplasia were identified in 7/10 patients each. At least one prioritized variant in either genes related to VUR per se or renal hypodysplasia was seen in 8/10 patients. All patients carried different variations. Among the remaining two patients, one carried a pathogenic CNV. In the VUR family, a rare and deleterious variant in SLIT1 gene was identified. Sharp phenotyping in combination with exome sequencing using a combination of approaches including hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-free for prioritization of SNVs and study of CNVs seems to be an optimal method of genetic discovery of VUR. VUR is genetically heterogenous.",

    "abstract": "Optic disc size measurement is essential for determining landmarks, lesions, and distances of the retina. Due to the size variability in nature and when measured with different instruments, newer methods to compare sizes between different instruments are needed. We aimed to determine the comparability of slit lamp, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of optic disc size after correcting for both ocular and instrument magnification. In this prospective, observational study, optic disc size was measured by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fundus photography, and OCT. Instrument and ocular magnification was calculated, and the measured size was corrected for both using the Littman formula. The corrected values were analyzed using Bland-Altman plots and intra-class correlation (ICC) for agreeability and correlation, respectively. Linear regression analysis was conducted to estimate the systematic errors and interconvertibility in cases of high correlation. Fifty-six eyes were included for the analysis. Uncorrected and corrected values for each method had excellent correlation and agreeability (ICC absolute agreement >0.75, <i>P</i> < 0.01). Among magnification corrected values, slit lamp and OCT had excellent correlation and agreement (ICC consistency = 0.846, confidence interval 0.75-0.91, <i>P</i> < 0.01). This pair had <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.73 on linear regression (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Linear regression formulas for interconverting uncorrected and corrected values for the three methods had variable accuracy (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> from 0.47 to 0.66). Uncorrected values of different methods for disc size measurement cannot be compared directly; they need ocular and instrument magnification correction. Among the three methods compared, the best interconvertible pairs of measurement were magnification corrected slit lamp and OCT values.",

Ethnographic research was conducted over a five-month period in 2022 with six women who visited their partners in prison. Gender and socioeconomic status, characterized by structural violence, emerged as social markers responsible for limiting women's choices and rendering them vulnerable. Institutional violence was evident in episodes of moral and psychological violence experienced by the women, revealing the effects of indirect institutionalization. It is concluded that incarceration represents a repository of social exclusion. It is marked by structural violence and is responsible for perpetuating unjust institutional structures, which condition women to social experiences marked by precarity, privation of opportunities, and lack of legal protections.",

We examine these issues using data from the 2013 Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel and 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) accelerometer studies, both of which collected survey data in advance and therefore permit comparisons of self-reported physical activity between participants and nonparticipants to the accelerometer studies. While individuals with high levels of self-reported physical activity are overrepresented in the participant samples, the differences are modest in both studies. However, in the LISS panel this difference led to overestimates of physical activity that are not fully corrected by propensity score weighting adjustments (i.e., non-ignorable selection bias). This finding underscores the importance of assessing the potential influence of nonparticipation on accelerometer-derived estimates of physical activity.",

    "abstract": "Therapist negative beliefs about exposure have been identified as a key contributor to underutilization and suboptimal delivery of exposure-however, supporting evidence is derived from laboratory analogue studies and therapist self-report. Benito and colleagues (2021b) completed a training trial that included rigorous coding of videotaped in-session delivery behavior among a sample of therapists (<i>N</i> = 16) who received workshop training followed by ongoing consultation. The present study is a secondary analysis evaluating the relationship between Therapist Beliefs About Exposure Scale (TBES) scores and actual delivery behavior with anxious children/adolescents in the community. Marginally significant findings suggested that lower pretraining TBES scores (i.e., fewer negative beliefs about exposure) were associated with more frequent exposure usage, and that increased use of anxiety-increasing behaviors was related to greater reduction in therapist negative beliefs about exposure over the course of training. Belief levels did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference based on setting (community mental health vs. private practice). Although future studies with larger samples are needed, current findings extend growing evidence highlighting therapist beliefs about exposure as a potential influence on exposure utilization and delivery quality in real-world settings. Dissemination efforts involving the development of training strategies to promote exposure use in community settings are discussed.",

It is thus critical to develop low-cost, reliable methods that utilize publicly available imagery (e.g., Google Street View; GSV) to comprehensively audit neighborhoods. We aimed to create a reliable, efficient, and scale-flexible virtual audit of neighborhood disorder (Lot Assessment of Neighborhood Disorder; LAND) that can be aggregated to larger geographical units. A total of 710 block faces on 355 street segments were coded in Detroit, MI. We tested reliability between coders on 20% of the sample (71 segments (i.e., two sides of the street); 146 block faces (i.e., one side of the street) and found reliability was adequate at the individual lot (Kappas ranged from .60 - 1), block face (ICCs ranged from .94 -.98), and segment (ICCs ranged from .96-.98) levels, with the sole exception of graffiti (for which ICCs were typically in the .56 to .57 range). Moreover, LAND's score was positively correlated with number of vacant lots, area deprivation, and resident perceptions of their neighborhood. Overall, LAND evidence higher levels of reliability than previous physical neighborhood disorder virtual audits and evidenced significant correlations across several known correlates of physical neighborhood disorder, thus highlighting LAND as an effective virtual audit tool in the study of physical neighborhood disorder.",

The study evaluates different horticultural wastes to utilize it as media component to develop a cheaper media formulation for biopigment production using <i>Rhodotorula</i> sp. MTCC 1446. Proximate analysis of wastes revealed the optimum level of total sugars, reducing sugars, titratable acidity, macro and micronutrients in potato waste for growth of <i>Rhodotorula</i> sp. yeast culture. Concentration optimization showed the 5.0% (w/v) potato waste as media component resulted in 2.82 ± 0.8 g/kg biomass and 259.46 ± 9.5 µg/g biopigment productions. Standardization of growth conditions were carried out implementing Response Surface Methodology. Optimized growth conditions for <i>Rhodotorula</i> sp. were found to be pH 7.0, 30 °C, 66 h incubation time and 362.5 g DAHP addition that lead to production of 34.60 g/L biomass and 3345.82 µg/g biopigment. Validation at 3L scale showed the production of 32.6 g/L biomass and 3152.42 µg/g biopigment with the desirability of 98%. Characterization discovered the presence of carotenoids having antimicrobial, anticancerous, antioxidant properties and stability studies revealed the thermostable (up to 70 °C) and UV light and sunlight stability for 4 h of biopigment. Utilization of biopigment in food products increased the nutraceutical value of the product by increasing its phenolic content as well as appearance of the respected food items. In conclusion, the biopigment produced growing <i>Rhodotorula</i> sp. on potato waste based media under optimal conditions represents a viable natural substitute to artificial food colors in food industry.

Prolonged DI is a major contributor to deaths among children with malignancies in low-middle-income countries (LMICs). The data on DI and factors affecting it are limited from LMIC. This cross-sectional study enrolled patients/children<12 years with proven/suspected malignancies. Children already on definitive chemotherapy, who died before a definitive diagnosis and with benign tumours were excluded. The parents or caregivers were interviewed individually using a customized questionnaire. Various intervals in referral chain like patient interval/delay (PI), DI and treatment interval/delay (TI) and factors affecting DI were evaluated. Out of 120 eligible children; 79 with median age 43 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 28-81) were analyzed. Haematological malignancies (n = 40) and non-haematological malignancies (n = 39) were equally distributed. Median total delay was 74 days (14-88 days). Median DI was 17 days (IQR: 8-54). The main contributor to delay was due to referral delay by primary and secondary physician (p < 0.05). The median PI was 2 day (IQR: 0-7.5) and median TI was 1 day (IQR: 0-4). Prolonged DI (DI > 30 days) was seen in 33 (41.8%) children. Trial of alternative medicine was the only significant factor associated with prolonged DI in univariate and multivariate analysis with odds ratio of 6.24. Other demographic, socioeconomic, health-seeking journey and disease-related factors were not found to be associated with prolonged DI. Significant delay exists in paediatric cancer management in LMIC. Augmentation of physician and parental awareness is the key to decrease these delays.",

The analysis of data collected from the Türkiye Health Surveys conducted by Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSAT) in 2016 and 2019 involved using the Chi-Square independence test. Effect sizes were evaluated using Phi or Cramer's V coefficients. Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) module was used to scan the depressive symptoms. The adult population's point of prevalence of depressive symptoms was 4.7%±0.24 in males and 8%±0.19 in females, with a population total of 6.3%±0.21. The yearly prevalence of depressive symptoms was 6.1%±0.45 in males, 13.2%±0.53 in females and a population total of 10%±0.49. Age, gender, income, education, social support, health status, disability, and chronic illnesses were found to be significant predictors of the incidence of depressive symptoms (p<0,05). The results indicated that the rate of people with depression getting help from psychologists, psychotherapists, and psychiatrists was low. Age, gender, income, education, marital status, self-rated health status, social support, number of chronic illnesses, and disability were the most important risk factors for depressive episodes. In addition to such self-reported research completed before the pandemic and Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in Türkiye, further studies based on structured diagnostic interviews are required.",

    "abstract": "Sexual assault is a widespread issue on college campuses, wherein men disproportionately perpetrate this form of violence against women. While cross-sectional research has helped identify salient risk factors related to sexual perpetration, it remains critical for researchers to understand how these risk factors vary over time; however, numerous challenges exist to conducting longitudinal research on sexual perpetration. The current study was conducted to address one of the logistical barriers to longitudinal research - linking data anonymously - by examining two methods for participant-generated study IDs. Further, the current study examines if specific predictors of sexual assault (i.e., trait aggression, sexual assault victimization, and perpetration history) are related to study retention and successful re-creation of study IDs over time. Participants included 271 college students (95.1% men) who completed the baseline survey, with 56.1% (<i>n</i> = 152) of the total sample whose data was retained for analyses were randomly assigned to create type A IDs and 43.9% (<i>n</i> = 119) randomly assigned to create type B IDs. A total of 35.1% of the study sample (<i>n</i> = 95) completed the one-week follow-up survey and successfully matched their IDs across time-points. There were no differences between ID types in match rates. Further, results indicated that no differences were detected related to sexual assault-specific predictors on either successful matching of IDs across time, or in study retention. While none of the individual difference variables significantly predicted study retention or successful ID matching across time, numerous practical implications for improving longitudinal research related to sexual assault are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of low dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) as a mobilization regimen in multiple myeloma and lymphoma patients during covid-19. This is a single-center retrospective study conducted at Stem Cell Transplantation Unit of University of Health Sciences Adana City Training and Research Hospital, between September 2020 and August 2022. Fourty-one patients who underwent stem cell mobilization with low dose cyclophosphamide plus granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were included. Cyclophosphamide was administered with a dosage of 2000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for one day and G-CSF was started at a dosage of 10 μg/kg/day 2 or 5 days after the Cy application and was continued until obtaining adequate product or mobilization failure. The median age of the patients at the time of mobilization was 57 years (range, 21-68). Eighteen (43.9%) patients were female and 23 (56.1%) were male. An adequate number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were collected in 38 (92.7%) patients with a product yield of ≥ 2 × 10<sup>6</sup>/kg CD34 + cells while the rate of mobilization failure was 7.3% (3 of 41). In conclusion, low dose Cy with G-CSF seems to be an effective mobilization regimen prior to ASCT with a reasonable toxicity in the era of Covid-19 disease.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to provide genetic evidence linking drinking habits of different beverages (DHDB) to sleep disorder liability (SDL), potentially informing clinical treatments to improve lifestyle factors. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method was employed to explore the genetic associations between DHDB and SDL. The DHDB variables studied encompassed alcohol intake (ALI), alcohol intake frequency (ALF), high-frequency drinking with meals (HAL), tea intake (TEAI), coffee intake (COFI), and red wine intake (RWI). The SDL variables analyzed were insomnia (INS), inhibit excitability (IE), and sleep duration (SD). The MR analysis identified genetic links between ALI and INS, ALF and IE, ALF and SD, HAL and INS, HAL and IE, HAL and SD, TEAI and IE, TEAI and SD, and COFI and IE (<i>p</i> (inverse variance weighting - IVW) < 0.05). Nonetheless, no significant genetic links were detected between ALI and IE, ALI and SD, ALF and INS, TEAI and INS, COFI and INS, COFI and SD, RWI and INS, RWI and IE, or RWI and SD (<i>p</i> (IVW) > 0.05). Alcohol intake may elevate insomnia risk without affecting daytime sleepiness or sleep duration. Frequent alcohol consumption may lead to daytime sleepiness and reduced sleep duration but not insomnia. Alcohol with meals might reduce insomnia and daytime sleepiness while improving sleep duration. Tea appears unlinked to insomnia and may reduce daytime drowsiness. Coffee may alleviate daytime drowsiness without causing insomnia, and red wine shows no significant association with sleep disorders. Reverse MR suggests potential links between sleep disorders and alcohol or caffeine intake.",

    "abstract": "Uric acid (UA) is the end product of the metabolism of purine compounds. There is overwhelming evidence linking hyperuricaemia (high levels of UA) and cerebrovascular diseases, but the effect of high levels of UA on cerebral vessels is not fully understood. The aim of this research is to clarify how UA affects the endothelin (ET) receptor in rat cerebral arteries and the related mechanism. In an <i>in vitro</i> setting, segments of rat cerebral arteries (<i>n</i> = 12) were exposed to high levels of UA, either alone or in conjunction with MAPK pathway inhibitors. ET agonists were used to induce contractions that were then measured with a myograph. ET receptor expression was measured using RT-PCR (<i>n</i> = 6), western blot (<i>n</i> = 3), or immunohistochemistry (<i>n</i> = 3) to quantify mRNA and protein levels. The study revealed that high levels of UA notably increase ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub> receptor-induced contractions and boosted the expression of ET receptors in cerebral arteries when compared to fresh or cultured alone, suggesting that UA enhances ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub> receptors. Additionally, the up-regulation of ET<sub>B</sub> receptors induced by UA was inhibited by the p38 inhibitor SB203580, the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. SB203580 significantly blocked the increase in ET<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated contractions induced by UA and the upregulation of ET<sub>A</sub> receptor. Neither SP600125 nor U0126 had such an effect. High levels of UA stimulate the up-regulation of ET receptors in rat cerebral arteries <i>in vitro</i> through MAPK pathways. This study may offer novel perspectives on hyperuricaemia-associated cerebrovascular diseases.",

    "title": "Examining a Critical Race Theory-Informed Undergraduate Research Experience: Proposing a Conceptual Model of the Benefits of Anti-Racist Programs on Student Development.",
    "abstract": "Hate crimes and racist incidents are occurring with alarming and increasing frequency on college and university campuses. As colleges work to reduce racist incidents on campus, there is still a need to prepare students to respond to racism when it occurs. When students are prepared to respond to racist incidents, they tend to have better mental health. We draw on prior literature to examine whether learning about critical race theory (CRT) and receiving CRT-informed mentoring-as embedded in an undergraduate research experience program-related to four-year college students' self-assessed ability to respond to racism. Specifically, we propose and test a conceptual model to examine the benefits of participating in an undergraduate research experience program that required students to learn about CRT and receiving CRT-informed mentorship. Consistent with prior literature on undergraduate research experience programs, we found that the intervention positively related to students' sense of self-efficacy and science identity, but it did not have an independent, direct relationship with self-assessed ability to respond to racism. However, the intervention indirectly supports students' preparedness to respond to racism through its positive relationship with self-efficacy. As state legislatures around the country work to ban CRT, this paper offers empirical evidence that embedding CRT in university programs can support student development in multiple related ways.",

    "abstract": "About 5.2 million children and adolescents (4.4 million of whom are citizens) live with at least one undocumented immigrant parent in the US. Increased immigration enforcement under former President Trump put thousands of mixed-status families with children at risk for family separation via deportation. Additionally, enforcement activities bolstered an anti-immigrant/anti-Latinx climate that encouraged discriminatory or racist rhetoric and encounters against Latinx families across the country. This study examines the extent to which distinct types of hostile immigration experiences, namely discrimination, detainment, and parental deportation increase the mental health burden on Latinx adolescents with at least one immigrant parent. We used baseline survey data (n=101) from the Between the Lines Study, a panel pilot study with US-citizen adolescents (13 to 17 years) with at least one Mexican origin parent or caregiver affected by or at risk for parental deportation, conducted across the United States from 2019 to 2020. We examined the effects of exposure to different levels of immigration enforcement and perceived discrimination on mental health symptomology by fitting multivariable logistic regression models. After adjusting for other covariates, exposure to parental deportation significantly increased the odds of high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms among participants. Similarly, exposure to discrimination significantly increased the odds of high levels of depressive symptoms and internalized stigma. Immigration enforcement and discrimination both negatively affect Latinx citizen adolescents' mental health. In the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, evidenced-based, family-friendly policies and interventions that prioritize psychological well-being are necessary to reduce mental health disparities.",

    "abstract": "Reproducibility is a basis of scientific integrity, yet it remains a significant challenge across disciplines in computational science. This reproducibility crisis is now being met with an Open Science movement, which has risen to prominence within the scientific community and academic libraries especially. At the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, the Open Science and Data Collaborations (OSDC) Program promotes Open Science practices with resources, services, and events. Hosting hackathons in academic libraries may show promise for furthering such efforts. To address the need for reproducible computational research and promote Open Science within the community, members of the OSDC Program organized a single-day hackathon centered around reproducibility. Partnering with a faculty researcher in English and Digital Humanities, we invited community members to reuse Python code and data from a research publication deposited to Harvard Dataverse. We also published these materials as a compute capsule in Code Ocean that participants could also access. Additionally, we investigated ways to use ChatGPT to troubleshoot errors from rerunning this code. Three students from the School of Computer Science participated in this hackathon. Accessing materials from Harvard Dataverse, these students found success reproducing most of the data visualizations, but they required some manual setup and modifications to address depreciated libraries used in the code. Alternatively, we found Code Ocean to be a highly accessible option, free from depreciation risk. Last, ChatGPT also aided in finding and addressing the same roadblocks to successfully reproduce the same figures as the participating students. This hackathon allowed several students an opportunity to interact with and evaluate real research outputs, testing the reproducibility of computational data analyses. Partnering with faculty opened opportunities to improve open research materials. This case study outlines one approach for other academic libraries to highlight challenges that face reproducibility in an interactive setting.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have linked placental weight (PW) to cardiovascular diseases, but the causality and potential mediators underlying this relationship are still unknown. We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis via summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including PW adjusted for sex, 21 candidate mediators and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which includes coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke (IS). Two-step MR was employed to identify and assess the mediation and proportion of potential mediators in the association between PW and ASCVD. Additionally, we conducted a repeated analysis using PW adjusted for gestational age and sex. Univariable MR (UVMR) analysis revealed that for each 1-SD decrease in fetal genotype-determined PW adjusted for sex only, the risk of CHD increased by 24% (95% CI: 1.05-1.46) and the risk of large artery stroke (LAS) increased by 46% (95% CI: 1.13-1.89). Similar results were obtained in repeated analyses. The mediation MR analysis revealed that the causal relationship between fetal genotype-determined PW and CHD risk was primarily mediated by birthweight, type 2 diabetes, and education, each mediating 3.66% to 40.80% of the total effect. The causal relationship between fetal genotype-determined PW and LAS risk was mediated mainly by type 2 diabetes, which accounted for 22.11% of the total effect. This study identified a unidirectional causal relationship between lower PW and a greater ASCVD risk, with factors such as birthweight, type 2 diabetes, and education mediating the association between PW and ASCVD.",

The discovery of colonic adenocarcinoma was on operative specimen after histologic examination. The patient underwent left oncologic colectomy with stoma. Follow-up at one year postoperatively did not detect tumor recurrence. Clinical implications of the association between these two neoplasms are not clearly described. Treatment depends on the the most aggressive histologic type or obviously highest stage. Knowledge of the genetic data of this association offers opportunity of treatment with the new targeted-therapy molecules. Surgical resection, may remain the curative treatment. Synchronous adenocarcinoma and GIST has been more commonly described in the stomach.  The pathogeneses of tumorigenesis may not be the same for the two tumors. More studies seem be necessary to clarify a potential role of different genes in the development of adenocarcinomas. And therefore, above all their therapeutic implications.",

Case report. A 13-year-old girl presented with sudden visual loss in her right eye. Ophthalmic examination revealed a large choroidal osteoma complicated by subretinal and subretinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) hemorrhage, suggestive of CNV. Intravitreal bevacizumab injections were administered, leading to substantial improvement in vision and resolution of subretinal and sub-RPE hemorrhage. Follow-up showed that further injections were unnecessary as the CNV regressed. Literature review identified 25 cases of CNV associated with choroidal osteoma, with bevacizumab being the most frequently used anti-VEGF agent. Multiple injections were often required, though single-dose injections also proved effective in some cases. The majority of patients experienced visual improvement following treatment. Anti-VEGF agents, like bevacizumab, appear to be a promising treatment option for CNV secondary to choroidal osteoma, potentially preserving and improving vision with limited injections.",

    "abstract": "Simulation-based calibration checking (SBC) is a practical method to validate computationally-derived posterior distributions or their approximations. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of SBC to alleviate several known problems. Our variant allows the user to in principle detect any possible issue with the posterior, while previously reported implementations could never detect large classes of problems including when the posterior is equal to the prior. This is made possible by including additional data-dependent test quantities when running SBC. We argue and demonstrate that the joint likelihood of the data is an especially useful test quantity. Some other types of test quantities and their theoretical and practical benefits are also investigated. We provide theoretical analysis of SBC, thereby providing a more complete understanding of the underlying statistical mechanisms. We also bring attention to a relatively common mistake in the literature and clarify the difference between SBC and checks based on the data-averaged posterior. We support our recommendations with numerical case studies on a multivariate normal example and a case study in implementing an ordered simplex data type for use with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The SBC variant introduced in this paper is implemented in the SBC R package.",

    "abstract": "The optimal goal in the management of refractory/relapsed classical Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R-cHL) is to obtain minimal disease status before stem cell transplantation (SCT). The efficiency of BEGEV (bendamustin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine) regimen is well-established as first-line salvage therapy in earlier studies. The search for novel treatment continues for patients with limited options in later lines. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of BEGEV regimen in heavily pretreated, platinum-resistant, R/R-cHL. In this single-center retrospective trial, patients diagnosed with R/R-cHL between 2018 and 2023 were analyzed. Patients who received BEGEV in third- or fourth-line treatment were eligible. Patient's demographic characteristics, pathology results, treatment and survival outcomes were recorded. Overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and toxicity were analyzed. A total of 31 patients were included in this study. 27 (87.2%) patients were treated with BEGEV in the 3rd line and 4 (12.8%) patients were treated in the 4th line. The results show an ORR of 90.3%, with 54.9% achieving complete response. The median PFS and OS after the BEGEV regimen was 20.2 (range 15-23.6) and 23.2 (range 15.4-40.8) months, respectively. The regimen demonstrated acceptable toxicity, with the most common severe adverse events being neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. SCT was successfully performed in 100% of the patients after BEGEV treatment. Our findings suggest that BEGEV is a viable and effective treatment option for heavily pretreated, platinum-resistant R/R-cHL patients, particularly in regions with limited access to novel therapies.",

    "abstract": "Prevalence of anaemia is 67% in children between 6 and 59 months of age. There is a discrepancy in prevalence of anaemia in view of various cutoffs and capillary versus venous sampling. Prevalence studies at various levels are mandated for planning and implementation of policies to control anaemia. This cross-sectional observational hospital-based multi-centric study enrolled apparently healthy eligible children aged between 6 and 59 months from Armed Forces Medical Services hospitals and estimated the prevalence of anaemia in \"venous blood samples\". Demographic and anthropometric details and a questionnaire-based survey to study individual and community-related risk factors associated with anaemia were noted. A total of 10,814 children from 20 hospitals were eligible. A total of 2231 children (56.9% male) were analyzed. The prevalence of anaemia was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.3-51.5) as defined by the World Health Organization (mild: 24.1%, moderate: 23.5%, and severe: 1.8%) and 19.6% (95%CI:18-21.3) as per the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey. Majority of anaemia was microcytic (67.2%). Presumptive iron-deficiency anaemia was seen in 55.7%. In binary logistic regression analysis, age<24 months, inadequacy of nutrition and poor maternal education were the associated risk factors in all children with anaemia, while not giving exclusive breast feed till 6 months was an additional risk factor in children with moderate to severe anaemia. We report a high prevalence (49.4%) of anaemia in children aged between 6 and 59 months, with predominantly lower-middle socioeconomic status. Individual factors such as age<24 months, inadequate nutrition, and community-related risk factors such as poor maternal education and not giving exclusive breast feed for 6 months were associated with anaemia in our cohort.",

    "abstract": "Lead-acid battery (LAB) manufacturing is growing in Bangladesh because of the expanding automotive industry and low lead prices. Although these factories employ a big workforce, the working environment has led to concerns about the possible health risks for employees. This study aimed to address this issue by investigating workplace chemical and physical hazards in three LAB industries and evaluating health outcomes among workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 72 LAB factory workers, and participants were recruited by simple random sampling. A validated questionnaire was used to collect information on self-reported exposures to physical and chemical risks and related health effects. Data analysis was performed by using statistical software SPSS version 25. The age and work experience (Mean ± SD) of the participants were 34.2 ± 7.7 and 10.0 ± 5.7 years, respectively. High workplace temperature and noise from machinery, chemical odors, and skin exposure to acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) were reported by 52.8%, 51.4%, and 20.8% of workers, respectively. Insomnia (25.0%), abdominal pain (18.1%), joint pain (38.9%), memory loss (19.4%), headache (15.3%), low back pain (47.2%), eyesight problem (19.4%), physical weakness (47.2%), and hypertension (19.4%) were all common symptoms among the workers. Our study findings indicate that workers in LAB factories in Bangladesh are exposed to extreme temperatures, hazardous materials, and uncomfortable levels of noise, which can lead to serious health risks. To ensure the safety and well-being of employees, the LAB manufacturing sector in Bangladesh requires the immediate implementation of proper occupational health and safety standards.",

    "abstract": "BCR-ABL1-like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) represents a perplexing subclass of ALL mainly due to genomic heterogeneity and non-availability of standardized diagnostic tests. The data on prevalence, clinical-haematological profile and outcome are limited, more so from low-middle income countries. This prospective observational study enrolled children<14 years with B-ALL. Recurrent genetic/chromosomal aberrations were excluded. BCR-ABL1-like aberrations were analysed using Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Two groups with/without BCR-ABL1-like ALL (Mut+/Mut-) were compared. Out of 214 eligible children; 75 with \"B-other ALL\" were analysed for BCR-ABL1-like aberrations. Their prevalence was 34/214 (15.8%) in B-ALL and 34/75 (45.3%) in \"B-other\" ALL (PCR:33.3% and NGS:53.3%). Majority of the aberrations were JAK2E16 and ILR7e5/ILR7e6 with PCR and RAS pathway and PAX5 fusion with NGS. Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters including aberrant flowcytometry were comparable in Mut+ and Mut-groups. Children with day-8 absolute blast count (ABC) were higher in Mut+ group. High end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) was comparable in two groups. Number of NCI-standard risk (SR) at diagnosis with high D-8 ABC or high MRD was higher in Mut+ group. Similar results were found when aberrations were analysed by NGS alone. In all 56 children are alive, 19 had an event (relapse/death). The outcomes were comparable in two groups with median follow-up of 1075 days (IQR: 660-1527); when analysis was based on combined as well as NGS-based methodology alone. We report 15.8% prevalence of BCR-ABL1-like ALL in children by PCR or NGS. High D-8 ABC was associated with BCR-ABL1-like ALL with no impact on outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To establish normative values for macular sublayer thickness in healthy Iranian children using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to assess the effects of age and gender. This study was part of the population-based Shiraz pediatric eye study. Of 2400 children aged 6-12 years invited, 480 were randomly selected for optical biometry and macular spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) imaging. Finally, 431 OCT scans from children with medium axial length (AL; 21.5-26.5 mm) were analyzed. The OCT device automatically segmented seven retinal sublayers, and their thickness was measured across Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields. Thickness in the central 1-mm subfield was assessed by gender and age groups (6-9 vs. 10-12 years), adjusted for AL. Regression analysis examined the impact of age, sex, and AL on retinal sublayer thickness. Only data from the right eye were used. The mean age of participants was 9.12 ± 1.59 years (range, 6-12), with 254 (58.9%) being girls. The mean AL was 22.91 ± 0.71 mm, and the mean foveal thickness was 258 ± 8 µm. A normative database was created for the total retinal thickness and the seven retinal sublayers across the nine ETDRS subfields. Boys had longer globes (by approximately 0.4 mm; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and thicker foveae (by about 5 µm; <i>P</i> = 0.001) compared to girls. Among the seven sublayers studied, boys had a thicker ganglion cell complex layer (<i>P</i> = 0.014) and outer nuclear layer (ONL; <i>P</i> = 0.012), while girls had a thicker retinal pigment epithelium (RPE; <i>P</i> = 0.029). The inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer showed no significant differences (<i>P</i> = 0.075 and <i>P</i> = 0.810, respectively). The mean AL was 22.78 ± 0.68 mm in the 6-9 age group and 23.10 ± 0.72 mm in the 10-12 age group (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The older age group (10-12 years) exhibited thicker ONL (<i>P</i> = 0.009) and RPE (<i>P</i> = 0.002) layers compared to the younger group. This study provides normative data for macular sublayer thickness in Iranian children aged 6-12 years using Heidelberg SD-OCT. Boys had longer ALs and thicker maculae, while girls had a thicker RPE layer. Older children had longer globes and thicker retinas, mainly due to increased ONL and RPE thickness.",

    "abstract": "Child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) users elicit strong negative reactions from society and people within their networks. There are symbolic and social boundaries that these individuals have transgressed, and subsequent identity work involves the negotiation of self and self-presentation. This article combines results from two studies to explore negotiation of identity, symbolic and social boundaries, and associated narratives among 103 CSEM users. One study was an anthropological ethnography with 17 months of UK fieldwork in community-based group programs, and the other involved four months of interviews in sexual offense treatment units of a US prison. Participants' identity work had commonalities: distinguishing between acts vs identities; differentiating crimes from identities; comparing offenses to others viewed as worse; framing childhood experiences as influencing offending; and situating both offending and post-offending identities within larger society. Results are discussed in the context of debates about risk, treatment, prevention, harm, denial/downplay/minimization, and reintegration. Furthermore, we highlight how identity work occurs within potentially competing/contrasting personal, judicial, treatment, media, and societal reactions to and expectations of individuals who have committed sexual offenses. Finally, we demonstrate the methodological and analytical value of cross-disciplinary comparative qualitative research by showing similarities across participants from different countries, settings, timeframes, and interventions.",

    "abstract": "Dyadic research among male couples is of increasing interest to researchers, as relationship factors have been implicated in a variety of physical and mental health outcomes. A small evidence base suggests samples of same-gender couples that participate in research may be biased towards those with better relationship quality. Unfortunately, this research is limited and has not examined perceptions that might determine a respondent's willingness to recruit their partner, such as the perception that a partner would be willing to participate. This study examined whether relationship quality (i.e., satisfaction, commitment, and intimacy) was associated with perceptions of a partner's willingness to participate in dyadic research among same-gender male couples. Partnered sexual minority men (<i>n</i> = 5,317) recruited from dating/social networking applications completed a brief online survey. Bivariate analyses suggested that satisfaction, commitment, and intimacy were all associated with perceptions of a partner's willingness to participate in research, which persisted in the multivariable, multinominal regression models. Those who were younger, and living with HIV, as well as those with younger partners, were more likely to perceive their partner as willing to participate. Samples in dyadic research involving male couples might over-represent those with better relationship quality. They may also over-represent relatively younger sexual minority men and those living with HIV. Recruitment strategies should explore ways to facilitate the recruitment of couples with lower relationship quality to facilitate the generalizability of evidence-based practice.",

However, due to cultural and linguistic differences, Chinese Australians encounter substantial barriers to accessing these services. This study aimed to investigate the barriers preventing Chinese Australians from accessing palliative care services. Surveys and interviews were conducted with Chinese Australian cancer patients and their caregivers to assess their awareness, understanding, and challenges related to palliative care. Among 136 surveyed and eight interviewed participants, a significant lack of awareness and numerous misconceptions about palliative care were evident, with language as the primary barrier despite strong interest in such services. The results indicate a need to improve the awareness and accessibility of palliative care for the Chinese Australian community. Local health authorities and medical associations should collaborate in developing and disseminating culturally and linguistically appropriate information to increase service uptake among ethnic groups in Australia.",

    "title": "Graph-Based Bidirectional Transformer Decision Threshold Adjustment Algorithm for Class-Imbalanced Molecular Data.",
    "abstract": "Data sets with imbalanced class sizes, where one class size is much smaller than that of others, occur exceedingly often in many applications, including those with biological foundations, such as disease diagnosis and drug discovery. Therefore, it is extremely important to be able to identify data elements of classes of various sizes, as a failure to do so can result in heavy costs. Nonetheless, many data classification procedures do not perform well on imbalanced data sets as they often fail to detect elements belonging to underrepresented classes. In this work, we propose the BTDT-MBO algorithm, incorporating Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) approaches and a bidirectional transformer, as well as distance correlation and decision threshold adjustments, for data classification tasks on highly imbalanced molecular data sets, where the sizes of the classes vary greatly. The proposed technique not only integrates adjustments in the classification threshold for the MBO algorithm in order to help deal with the class imbalance, but also uses a bidirectional transformer procedure based on an attention mechanism for self-supervised learning. In addition, the model implements distance correlation as a weight function for the similarity graph-based framework on which the adjusted MBO algorithm operates. The proposed method is validated using six molecular data sets and compared to other related techniques. The computational experiments show that the proposed technique is superior to competing approaches even in the case of a high class imbalance ratio.",

This is a context in which different companies are born and die as a result of the interaction between the market and other factors. The objective of this research was to analysis of the survival of exporting agricultural companies in Peru, 2009-2019. To this end, data from the Commission for the Promotion of Peru for Exports and Tourism (Promperu) was utilised. The methodological contribution of the research is based on the quantitative approach, of basic type with a descriptive elk; being the population that involves a total of data of the agricultural exporting companies of Peru in the period 2009-2019 and the sample is census and the non-parametric statistical technique used was the Kaplan Meier estimate for the estimation of the survival rate. Exports of Peru's non-traditional agricultural sector in FOB value have had an average annual growth of 12% in terms of FOB value and 9% in terms of volume exported; the entry rate of new agro-exporting agricultural companies reached an average growth of 2.3% and the exit rate reached an average of 2.2% in the period 2009-2019. The survival of exporting companies in the non-traditional agricultural sector is critical, where 89% of them survive only one year, while in the second year only 75% survive and in the sixth year only 33% survive.",

The study was conducted on patients referred to Shiraz TB laboratory from March 21, 2022, to March 20, 2023. Considering culture as the gold standard, we determined and compared the accuracy of GeneXpert assay and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve between high- and low-risk groups, i.e., HIV-positive or AFB smear-positive ones vs. HIV-negative ones with negative AFB smear. There was not a significant difference between the accuracy of the high- and low-risk groups (91.34 vs. 92.44, p = 0.664). While the sensitivity (95.23), specificity (92.29), and NPV (99.72) in the low-risk group were high, the PPV of the group (39.89) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than that of the high-risk group (83.86). Because of the low PPV of the assay in HIV-negative patients with negative AFB smears, our study could not confirm the necessity of conducting the assay for the low-risk patients.

    "title": "How to Improve the Explanatory Power of an Intelligent Textbook: a Case Study in Legal Writing.",
    "abstract": "Explanatory processes are at the core of scientific investigation, legal reasoning, and education. However, effectively explaining complex or large amounts of information, such as that contained in a textbook or library, in an intuitive, user-centered way is still an open challenge. Indeed, different people may search for and request different types of information, even though texts typically have a predefined exposition and content. With this paper, we investigate how explanatory AI can better exploit the full potential of the vast and rich content library at our disposal. Based on a recent theory of explanations from Ordinary Language Philosophy, which frames the explanation process as illocutionary question-answering, we have developed a new type of interactive and adaptive textbook. Using the latest question-answering technology, our e-book software (YAI4Edu, for short) generates on-demand, expandable explanations that can help readers effectively explore teaching materials in a pedagogically productive way. It does this by extracting a specialized knowledge graph from a collection of books or other resources that helps identify the most relevant questions to be answered for a satisfactory explanation. We tested our technology with excerpts from a textbook that teaches how to write legal memoranda in the U.S. legal system. Then, to see whether YAI4Edu-enhanced textbooks are better than random and existing, general-purpose explanatory tools, we conducted a within-subjects user study with more than 100 English-speaking students. The students rated YAI4Edu's explanations the highest. According to the students, the explanatory content generated by YAI4Edu is, on average, statistically better than two baseline alternatives (<i>P</i> values below .005).",

Oleoresins of turmeric, chilli, and coriander were mixed in a definite ratio to get the flavour and aroma of the generally used spice mix in south India. The blend was microencapsulated by spray drying using three different carrier agent combinations, such as gum arabic - GA, maltodextrin - MD, and sodium caseinate - SC for comparison. The use of MD: GA combination had the highest encapsulation efficiency of 77.14 ± 2.05% and an encapsulation yield of 45.92 ± 0.85%, surpassing MD: SC and MD: GA: SC combinations. Physical parameters like hygroscopicity and solubility were higher for MD: GA combination, along with better particle morphology and improved flowability. Retention of active compounds in the microencapsulated powder having MD and GA combination was observed as 98.57% for curcumin, 93.52% for capsaicin, and 95.61% for linalool. The findings obtained in the present study indicated that combining MD and GA effectively protected the oleoresin and enhanced its stability compared to the other two combinations.",

    "abstract": "<i>In situ</i> bioprinting has been identified as a promising tissue engineering technique for treating volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries. However, the success of this procedure significantly depends on the uniform and precise deposition of cells contributing to the regeneration of muscles. To address this critical need, in this work, we present design and quantitative evaluation of a novel autonomous <i>in situ</i> bioprinting surgical robotic framework that can be used with a generic bioprinting material. The proposed framework consists of three main components: (i) a bioprinting tool integrated with a seven-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator to perform a precise autonomous bioprinting procedure; (ii) a unique 3D visual measurement framework comprised of a high-accuracy structured light camera with complementary 2D/3D computer vision algorithms- to enable online and accurate measurement and reconstruction of the bioprinted constructs; and (iii) a quantitative evaluation module with novel assessment metrics- to characterize and evaluate the performance of the bioprinting process toward finding optimal bioprinting parameters. To ensure the biological functionality of a printed construct using our robotic system, we performed 90 experiments and identified optimal bioprinting parameters using the proposed novel assessment metrics. This paper was motivated by the problem of volumetric muscle loss treatment using an <i>in situ</i> bioprinting procedure but it also can be applied for treatment of skin and cartilage injuries. Existing approaches to perform <i>in situ</i> bioprinting is limited to either manual handheld bioprinting devices- that suffer from poor manual control and inaccurate printing constructs- or robotic systems- that have been developed without (i) considering a realistic surgical workflow and (ii) quantitatively evaluating the quality of printed constructs. To collectively address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel autonomous <i>in situ</i> robotic bioprinting framework. We also introduce unique and complementary quantitative assessment metrics to characterize and evaluate the performance of the bioprinting process. Experiments suggest that the proposed framework can robustly identify optimal bioprinting parameters to ensure the biological functionality of a printed construct using our robotic system.",

    "title": "Standardised and Objective Dietary Intake Assessment Tool (SODIAT): Protocol of a dual-site dietary intervention study to integrate dietary assessment methods.",
    "abstract": "Current dietary assessment methods struggle to accurately capture individuals' dietary habits. The 'Standardised and Objective Dietary Intake Assessment Tool' (SODIAT)-1 study aims to assess the effectiveness of three emerging technologies (urine and capillary blood biomarkers, wearable camera technology) and two online self-reporting dietary assessment tools to monitor dietary intake. This randomised controlled crossover trial was conducted at two sites (Hammersmith Hospital and the University of Reading) and aimed to recruit 30 UK participants (aged 18-70 years, BMI 20-30 kg/m <sup>2</sup>). Exclusion criteria included recent weight change, food allergies/intolerances, restrictive diets, certain health conditions and medication use. Volunteers completed an online screening questionnaire via REDCap and eligible participants attended a pre-study visit. Participants consumed, in a random order, two highly-controlled diets (compliant/non-compliant with UK guidelines) for four consecutive days, separated by at least one-week. Dietary intake was monitored daily using wearable cameras and self-recorded using Intake24 (24HR). Two versions of the online eNutri FFQ were completed: at baseline to assess habitual diet and on day 4 of each test period to record food intake. Urine and capillary blood samples were collected for biomarker analysis. Data analysis will assess dietary reporting accuracy across these methods using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. The SODIAT project introduced a novel approach to dietary assessment, aiming to address the limitations like misreporting and inclusivity. However, challenges persist, such as variability in biomarker data due to failure to follow sample storage requirements and the practicalities of wearing cameras throughout the day. To protect privacy, participants removed cameras at inappropriate times, and AI removed non-food related images and blurred faces/device screens captured on the images. The accuracy of the tools in a highly-controlled setting will be evaluated in this study. Future studies are planned to validate these tools further in free-living and minority populations.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an important enzyme that metabolizes commonly used drugs, such as tramadol hydrochloride. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 have been shown to influence the pharmacodynamic properties of administered drugs. This study aimed to screen postoperative patients (wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and CYP2D6 multiplication) of Minangkabau ethnicity in West Sumatera, Indonesia, who received tramadol using a modified long PCR method, and to investigate the clinical impact of tramadol on these patients. This study had a retrospective clinical trial registry number NCT06642480, and a total of 65 patients participated. The Reported Long PCR was modified using different DNA polymerases, optimizing annealing, and the number of step PCR to detect wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6. To ensure accurate PCR, the size of the PCR product was monitored: wild-type (5kb), CYP2D6*5 (6kb), and CYP2D6 multiplication genotype (10 kb). The wild-type PCR product was used as the control reaction. The method was applied to screen postoperative patients of Minangkabau ethnicity. A statistical study was conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a chi-square test. The Long PCR was successfully modified with a two-step PCR at 68°C as the annealing and extension temperatures. The screened genotype patients were dominated by the wild-type, followed by CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6 with percentages of 89%, 6,3%, and 4,7% respectively. A total of 6.3% of CYP2D6*5 cases were classified as heterozygous and predicted as intermediate metabolizers. Based on ANOVA analysis, there was a significant association between analgesic tramadol and VAS value, as well as between tramadol and molecular screening, with P-values of 0.045 and 0.003, respectively. The percentages of CYP2D6*5 and CYP2D6 multiplication genotypes were similar to those observed in another Asian population. Based on statistical analysis, tramadol was effective as an analgesic for postoperative Minangkabau ethnicity patients with wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiple CYP2D6 genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Females with lower limb amputations have different risk factors and lower success with their prostheses overall. Studying priorities of this population, specifically in how they differ between sexes, through survey methods may improve understanding of female-specific needs and inform sex-specific prosthetic design. To adapt the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire and use this to assess sex differences in needs and priorities of people with lower limb amputations (pLLAs). Cross-sectional questionnaire study. A committee was formed to modify the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire. The modified questionnaire was completed online by 26 pLLAs (13 females, 13 males). Sex differences in subscale and individual closed-question responses were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Sex differences in open-ended question responses were analyzed using affinity diagramming. Significant sex differences were found in subscale scores and separate closed questions, with resulting qualitative themes further suggesting sex-specific priorities and perspectives. Females reported lower satisfaction with prosthetic appearance, poorer overall ambulation abilities, and greater perception of social burden than males. Sex differences were also found in themes related to prosthesis satisfaction and other psychosocial factors including social adjustment. Findings demonstrated all-encompassing sex differences in the priorities and needs of pLLAs. This work can be used to better understand and target female's unique priorities through sex-specific considerations in research and prosthetic design.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a serious mental disorder that affects the individual, family, environment and society as a whole. In this study, we aimed to analyze the relationship between early maladaptive schemas and coping styles, with craving, reasons for consumption and finally remission history. This is a cross sectional study. We included 90 Erenköy Mental Health and Neurological Diseases Training and Research Hospital AMATEM patients with AUD according to DSM-5. AUD diagnosis is confirmed by SCID-5 CV. Subjects with additional psychiatric conditions are excluded. Subjects without withdrawal symptoms by CIWA-Ar are included. Sociodemographic data form, Young Schema Questionnaire Short form-3, Young Rygh Avoidance Inventory, Young Compensation Inventory, Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised, Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale was applied. Our findings show that male subjects who have early maladaptive schemas, especially in Impaired autonomy and performance; Failure, Disconnection and rejection; Social İsolation/alienation, Impaired Limits; Insufficient Self-Control/Self-Discipline domains, experience more cravings. Individuals coping with the Psychosomatism, Activity and Distraction, and Rebellion schemes experienced more craving. Those who coped with 'schema avoidance' tended towards alcohol consumption with Coping Motivation, and those who coped with 'schema compensation' with Impact Enhancement and Social motivations. There was no significant difference between the scores of the scales and the craving levels between the groups with and without a history of permanent remission. The data in our study showed that early maladaptive schemas and ways of coping with schemas are associated with craving. In the early stages of treatment, it is important to consider cognitive intervention focused on schemas and coping styles.",

    "abstract": "Despite the disproportionate impact of type 2 diabetes on racial/ethnic marginalized groups, interventions have not effectively engaged and retained these populations. To effectively meet the needs of these groups, a better understanding of barriers and facilitators to lifestyle change and participation in interventions is needed. The social determinants of health (SDOH) framework was utilized to examine barriers and facilitators in the National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) from the perspective of Lifestyle Coaches delivering the intervention to Black or Latinx participants. Using an online survey, coaches reported on barriers observed among participants and strategies to facilitate engagement and retention in the National DPP. We qualitatively coded and summarized responses. Black and Latinx participant-serving coaches shared five of the seven most endorsed barriers. Both groups of coaches shared the same four most endorsed facilitators. Results illustrate the impact SDOH have on one's ability to participate in diabetes prevention and enact lifestyle change, suggesting that an adapted approach may help to reach Black and Latinx participants. This project informs future National DPP implementation. Competencies in the following areas are addressed: Assessment of Needs and Capacity (I), Evaluation and Research (IV), and Advocacy (V).",

    "abstract": "Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are frequently positive in patients with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5-positive dermatomyositis (anti-MDA5+ DM). This study aimed to investigate the association between ANA and clinical characteristics as well as prognosis in a cohort of patients with anti-MDA5+ DM. We conducted a systematic retrospective study of medical records from a Nanjing Medical University cohort of patients with myositis-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD). Various parameters were compared and analyzed between the ANA-positive group and the ANA-negative group. A total of 246 patients with anti-MDA5+ DM were enrolled in this study, with 28.5% males and 71.5% females. The median age was 53.0 years, the median disease duration was 2 months, and the median follow-up period was 12.0 months. The ANA positivity rate at baseline was 52.4% in anti-MDA5+ DM patients. The ANA-positive group showed significantly higher positivity rates of anti-Ro52 antibodies (72.9% vs. 54.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (anti-ARS) antibodies (9.3% vs. 2.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.033) compared to the ANA-negative group, but lower ALT levels: 39.0 (21.5, 79.3) vs. 51.3 (36.5, 95.8), <i>p</i> = 0.006. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of overall survival, rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RPILD) incidence, age, disease duration, and clinical characteristics. In a subgroup analysis of the ANA-positive group, MDA5+++ patients had a higher incidence of RPILD compared to the MDA5+ group (<i>p</i> = 0.028). In the ANA-negative subgroup analysis, MDA5+++ patients had a higher mortality rate and worse prognosis compared to the MDA5+ group (<i>p</i> = 0.026). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and the presence of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RPILD) were associated with poor prognosis in ANA-negative anti-MDA5+ DM patients, with hazard ratios of 1.002 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.003, <i>p</i> = 0.020) and 13.694 (95% CI: 15.032, 37.267, <i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively. ANA is frequently found in patients with anti-MDA5+ DM. High titers of anti-MDA5 antibodies are associated with mortality and RPILD.",

    "abstract": "Inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis defect is considered a subset of the congenital glycosylation disorder that results from mutations in the genes encoding proteins participating in glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis and modification. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor proteins play important roles in numerous cellular processes including neurogenesis, cell adhesion, immune response, and signaling. Hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome-3 is one of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor defects, characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, seizures, and persistent hyperphosphatasia. The aims of this study were to investigate the clinical implications of the <i>PGAP2</i> gene and identify the severe phenotype. A male patient with dysmorphic features, neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, hearing loss, Hirschsprung disease, central fever, and elevated alkaline phosphatase was included in the study. The magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebral atrophy and corpus callosum hypoplasia. The whole-exome sequencing analysis of the individual and Sanger sequencing were performed for segregation. Additionally, next-generation sequencing, whole transcriptome sequencing, and homology modeling and analysis were performed. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous c.651C>G (p.His217Gln) in the <i>PGAP2</i> gene. The Sanger sequencing confirmed the parents were heterozygous. There is no splicing variant detected by whole transcriptome sequencing. The AlphaFold model was interpreted hypothetically. It observed the substitution of histidine, with glutamine, and may affect the stability of protein. Homozygous PGAP2 mutations in the patient we reported in our study resulted in a severe clinical picture including severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, severe epilepsy, dysmorphic features, central fever, biochemical, hormonal, and immunological abnormalities. This patient would be the youngest case published in the literature. We showed that the instability of mutant PGAP2 protein that causes hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome-3 leads to more severe phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is typically seen as a \"healthy\" period in a person's life, free from illness. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.7 million adolescents die every year because of preventable causes such as suicide, injuries, and violence. The aim of this quality improvement initiative was to assess and improve the use and documentation of the psychosocial risk assessment tool; HEEADSSS, amongst non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in a paediatric tertiary centre emergency department (ED). This was a mixed method quality improvement initiative carried out over three phases in paediatric tertiary centre ED. Educational interventions were implemented and their efficacy assessed. There was a 277% (n = 9 increased to n = 34) improvement in the use and documentation of HEEADSSS in the post intervention phase of the study. Participants who had undertaken the intervention were significantly more likely to have either a partially or fully completed HEEADSSS assessment compared to those who had not (odds ratio [OR] = 5.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.45-7.75, <i>p</i> < 0.001; n = 409). Additionally, the odds of having a fully completed HEEADSSSassessment were significantly higher among those who received the intervention (OR = 4.08, 95% CI: 1.90-8.75, <i>p</i> < 0.001; n = 409). Clinical presentations synonymous with psychosomatic illness, such as chest pain, abdominal pain and headaches were more likely to have a HEEADSSS done following the intervention phase. The results demonstrate the efficacy of simple, accessible and education focused interventions. There is little documented in current literature about the efficacy of a proforma. In the field of adolescent medicine, there is a call for a multi-sectorial approach to be adapted, encompassing the educational, emotional, and financial needs of adolescents. Global health promotion strategies need to adjust to a prevention paradigm, focusing on the origin of adult mortality.",

Yet, little is known about the GAH experiences of TGD people during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Utilizing an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, and applying critical transgender and intersectional theories, we examined baseline survey data (<i>n</i> = 44) and follow-up semi-structured interview data (<i>n</i> = 18 qualitative sub-sample from quantitative participants) with a cohort of TGD persons from a COVID-19 eHealth intervention (#SafeHandsSafeHearts) in Toronto, Canada. <b><i>Results:</i></b> One-sixth (<i>n</i> = 6/39, 15.4%) of the survey sample reported reduced access to GAH because of COVID-19. Qualitative participants described widespread barriers to access and negative mental health impacts given de-prioritization of TGD health during the pandemic. The cessation of gender affirming surgeries, deemed nonessential, was of greatest concern, along with fear that substantial progress made in improving access to GAH was being unraveled. Nevertheless, community resilience was highlighted through discussion of community support, particularly the development of TGD communities of care to compensate for the lack of institutional support. Despite these struggles, participants embodied trans joy, an act of resistance, refusing to be erased by a system that devalues their healthcare needs. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Results inform recommendations for TGD healthcare and improvements that reprioritize TGD community health.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and relationship between structural and vascular measurements in pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (GEX). Observational, case-control, and monocentric study conducted from March 2022 to April 2023. The study population comprised 153 eyes from 83 individuals divided into three groups: healthy (49), PEX (51), and GEX (53), with healthy subjects randomly selected from a cohort of nonglaucomatous patients. Structural parameters, including ganglion cell complex (GCC) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) were measured using spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (OCT). Vascular parameters were obtained from papillary and macular scans through OCT-angiography (OCT-A). The papillary whole-image vessel density (pWiVD), circumpapillary vessel density (cpVD), papillary vessel density (pVD), vessel densities in the superior, temporal, inferior, and nasal quadrants, as well as the macular WiVD, and the parafoveal and perifoveal vessel densities were measured. Structural parameters involved mean RNFL, superior, temporal, inferior, and nasal quadrant RNFL thicknesses, mean, inferior, and superior GCC thicknesses. The analysis of OCT-A parameters revealed a significant decrease in all vascular densities measured in the papillary region between the GEX and PEX groups and between the PEX and control groups, except for the pVD, which was comparable between the latter 2 groups (<i>P</i> = 0.051). At the level of the macular region, we found a significant decrease in the vascular densities of the superficial plexus, more pronounced in the parafoveal region, in the GEX group compared to the PEX group and in the PEX group compared to the control group. No difference was noted in the deep vascular plexus. Strong correlations were noted between cpVD and average RNFL (<i>r</i> = 0.83), superficial parafoveal vessel density and GCC (<i>r</i> = 0.72), and between cpVD and superficial parafoveal vessel density (<i>r</i> = 0.84). Regression analyses showed cpVD (the area under the curve = 0.958) provided the best diagnostic value in distinguishing between PEX and GEX. cpVD is critical for detecting GEX, indicating that significant loss of peripapillary microvasculature with preserved structure strongly suggests GEX diagnosis.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between benzene and Risk Quotient (RQ) benzene concentrations with Malondialdehyde (MDA), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels in workers exposed to benzene in car painting workshops in Surabaya. This study used an observational design with a cross-sectional method conducted at two car paint workshops in Surabaya. The study population was all workers exposed to benzene in the two car paint workshops, aged between 20-65 years in 2019. The sample was taken using an random sampling method, involving 30 respondents. Inclusion criteria included workers exposed to benzene and willing to participate, while exclusion criteria included workers with a liver or kidney disease history. The variables studied included benzene concentration, benzene RQ (benzene metabolite), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as a marker of oxidative stress, and indicators of kidney function (BUN and creatinine levels). Data were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate analysis with Pearson correlation test. There was no significant relationship between concentrations, RQ benzene, and MDA levels in workers in painting in Surabaya (p> 0.05). There was no significant relationship between benzene concentration, BUN levels, and creatinine levels in paint workers in Surabaya (p> 0.05). There was no significant relationship between benzene RQ and BUN and creatinine levels in paint workers in Surabaya (p> 0.05). This study's results indicate that benzene's effects do not lead to impaired kidney function. The benzene RQ variable in this study did not become a determining factor in BUN and creatinine levels in workers.",

    "title": "Life Cycle Assessment of Microalgae-Based Products for Carbon Dioxide Utilization in Thailand: Biofertilizer, Fish Feed, and Biodiesel.",
    "abstract": "Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products - biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer - through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO <sub>2</sub> emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO <sub>2</sub> emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO <sub>2</sub> emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO <sub>2</sub>, representing about 14% of Thailand's total CO <sub>2</sub> emissions, contributing significantly to the country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.",

    "abstract": "Critically ill patients often exhibit low ionized calcium levels. This study aimed to investigate the potential of ionized calcium levels in distinguishing between acute and chronic anemia in emergency department patients receiving red blood cell transfusions. A prospective cross-sectional case series involving 472 patients was conducted. Patient data, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, units of blood products received, mechanical ventilation, inotropic therapy, emergency transfusion requirement, length of hospital stay, outcome, and mortality, were systematically recorded. Out of the 472 patients, 57.2% (<i>n</i> = 270) were hypocalcemic (I.Ca < 1.10 mmol/L). Chronic anemia was present in 58.9% (<i>n</i> = 278), while 41.1% (<i>n</i> = 194) had acute anemia (trauma + gastrointestinal bleeding). The mean I.Ca level in patients with acute anemia (1.05 ± 0.1) was significantly lower than in those with chronic anemia (1.08 ± 0.12) (<i>p</i> = 0.009). Patients with hypocalcemia had a significantly higher need for inotropic therapy (<i>p</i> = 0.026) and mechanical ventilation (<i>p</i> = 0.036). The ionized calcium level in patients receiving emergency transfusion (O Rh- and cross-match-compatible) was notably lower (1.02 ± 0.12) than in those receiving cross-matched transfusions (1.07 ± 0.11), with statistical significance (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Among hospitalized patients, hypocalcemic patients required recurrent transfusion at a statistically significant level (<i>p</i> = 0.004). The ROC curves comparing the predictive power of blood gas parameters in emergency transfusion patients showed that lactate levels (AUC: 0.819, 95% CI: 0.761-0.877, <i>p</i> < 0.001, cut-off: 3.06) and ionized calcium levels (AUC: 0.619, 95% CI: 0.297-0.464, <i>p</i> = 0.005, cut-off: 0.96) had significant predictive value. Ionized calcium levels are a rapidly available blood gas parameter that assists clinicians in detecting trauma-induced acute anemia and identifying the need for recurrent transfusions. Additionally, both lactate and ionized calcium levels predict the necessity for emergency transfusion.",

    "abstract": "Managing invasive species requires identifying the factors that determine alien species invasion success. This study investigates how anthropogenic and biogeographical factors influence alien plant invasion in the Sanyang Wetlands, a human-dominated island system in Wenzhou City, China. Specifically, we analyzed whether human activities (e.g., habitat heterogeneity, proportion of road area, and cultivation) and island characteristics (e.g., island area, isolation) affect the diversity of native and invasive plant species similarly. We also assessed the applicability of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography to invasive plant species diversity and examined how these factors affect invasive plant species with different dispersal syndromes (anemochore, zoochore, and autochore). We found that both invasive and native species richness positively correlate with island area, habitat heterogeneity, and proportion of road area. However, although native species richness was negatively correlated with isolation, invasive species richness was not. The diversity and composition of invasive species with different dispersal syndromes were determined by different variables; for example, the composition and diversity of zoochores was increased by habitat heterogeneity, while anemochore species richness was increased by the proportion of road area, whereas anemochore species composition was influenced by distance to the nearest island. We conclude that habitat fragmentation differentially affects invasive and native plant diversity, aligning with the predictions of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography only for native species but not for invasive species. Our findings indicate that tailoring habitat attributes and regulating human activities could be effective strategies for mitigating the spread of invasive species in fragmented landscapes.",

    "abstract": "High-quality forms of contact, such as cross-group play and friendships, have been identified as particularly effective for promoting positive beliefs toward outgroup peers. Relations between children's cross-group play experiences and their beliefs about peers' math and science competencies and high-status occupational prospects have not yet been examined. Understanding these relations is important given that children from minoritized groups continue to face exclusion and bias in these domains. The present study examined the associations between children's (<i>N</i> = 983, <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 9.64, <i>SD</i> <sub>age</sub> = .89) reported cross-group play experiences and their math and science competency beliefs and high-status occupation expectations about girls and Black peers. Results revealed that, for majority group participants (i.e., boys and White children), higher levels of cross-group play were associated with significantly higher beliefs and expectations for girls and Black peers. Further, results demonstrated contexts in which higher levels of cross-group play were positively associated with girls' and Black children's beliefs and expectations for their own groups. Together, these findings advance theory and research on the benefits of cross-group contact in childhood by highlighting novel outcomes to which cross-group contact is positively related, as well as by showing that children from both minoritized and majority status groups stand to benefit from cross-group contact.",

This is the first report on the core gut microbiota of <i>M. masoniana</i> and <i>C. mrigala</i> using Illumina Miseq Sequencing. Gut bacterial diversity of crabs and fishes are studied from the rivers as well as farms. The core microbiome of crab gut samples consists of genera: <i>Bacteroides, Dysgonomonas, Lactobacillus, Leptotrichia, Acinetobacter, Prevotella, Prevotella 1, Pseudomonas, Fusobacterium</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i>. The core microbiome of fish gut samples consists of genera: <i>Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, Methanosaeta, Prevotella</i> and <i>Pseudomonas.</i> The result shows higher relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> in river Ravi than Chenab. Gut bacterial diversity of fishes and crabs of river Chenab is comparatively lower than the river Ravi. Three genera (<i>Bacteroides, Oceanobacillus</i> and <i>Lactococcus</i>) show significant variation (<i>p</i> value < 0.05) in fishes and crabs. Our study generated sequencing data on the gut microbiota of <i>M. masoniana</i> and <i>C. mrigala</i> can establish a base for the development of therapeutic approaches in dealing with the health conditions of diseased fishes and crabs.

    "abstract": "Despite the critical importance of blood donations in healthcare systems, many potential donors still need to be more confident. This study aimed to identify and analyze the factors contributing to blood donation reluctance among university students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 312 university students to gather data on the reasons for reluctance to donate blood. The survey included questions on demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding blood donation. Data pre-processing involved handling missing values and converting categorical responses into a numerical format suitable for machine learning analysis. K-means clustering was applied to categorize the responses into distinct groups. The optimal number of clusters was determined using silhouette scores, which resulted in the identification of eight distinct clusters. The eight clusters represented unique concerns, ranging from health-related misconceptions to logistical barriers. Key findings indicated that certain clusters were predominantly concerned with myths about health impacts, fear of needles, and a lack of awareness regarding the blood donation process. The results underscore the need for targeted educational campaigns to address specific misconceptions and informational gaps identified within each cluster. Strategic, data-driven outreach programs could significantly mitigate these barriers and potentially increase student participation in blood donation. Future research should explore longitudinal data to assess the effectiveness of tailored interventions and expand scope of the study to include diverse demographic groups to further generalize these findings.",

Phylogenetic analyses using <i>COI</i> and <i>COI</i>+<i>28S</i> data revealed the presence of five species associated with monoecious figs in Taiwan and neighboring regions: <i>Sycoscapter</i> <i>gajimaru</i> (Ishii), <i>Sycoscapter</i> <i>piceoscapus</i> Chou & Tzeng sp. nov., <i>Sycoscapter monticola</i> Chou & Tzeng sp. nov., <i>Sycoscapter</i> <i>ishiianus</i> Chou & Tzeng sp. nov., and <i>Sycoscapter</i> <i>littoralis</i> Chou & Tzeng sp. nov. Morphologically, these five <i>Sycoscapter</i> species possessed distinctive characteristics, including the male head shape, which distinguished them from related species. Furthermore, males of all five species exhibited rudimentary wing vestiges, commonly found in wasps associated with monoecious figs but absent in those associated with dioecious figs.

We propose and analyze a simple approach that computes eigenvalues as one-sided or two-sided Rayleigh quotients from eigenvectors of a random linear combination of the matrices in the family. We provide some analysis and numerous numerical examples, showing that such randomized approaches can compute semisimple joint eigenvalues accurately and lead to improved performance of existing solvers.",

    "abstract": "<i>Uncaria nervosa</i> Elmer is an Indonesian herbal plant that is traditionally used for breast cancer. The results of phytochemical screening contained alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the ethanol extract of this plant. Based on literature searches, reports regarding the bioactive compounds responsible for breast cancer have not been found. Further research is needed to understand the potential of <i>Uncaria nervosa</i> Elmer as a breast cancer treatment and to identify the specific compounds responsible for its effects. This study aims to determine the metabolite profiling of ethanol extract, the isolation, characterization of bioactive compounds, and their bioactivity in T47D breast cancer cells. The research began by extracting the leaves by maceration using 70% ethanol, and then solid phase extraction was carried out using the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. In this study, the sorbent used was polyamide. The extract was analyzed using a tandem analysis technique based on LCMS using the MZmine and SIRIUS platforms. Isolation was carried out using column chromatography, and preparative recycling HPLC. Bioactive compounds were characterized using UV, HPLC, NMR, and 2D NMR, as well as bioactivity tests using the MTT method. The results show that the extract contained N-[(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7-prop-2-ynylpurin-8-yl) amino] formamide, N-(3-phenylbutyl)hexan-2-amine, 1,1-Dichloro-1-nitrosopropane, ceratodictyol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, 7-methyl-N-[6-[(7-methyl-6-oxooctanoyl) amino] hexyl]-6-oxononanamide, nervisterol and 3,5,10-tris (acetyloxy)-2-hydroxy-4,14,16,16-tetramethyl-8-methylidene-13-oxo-15oxatetracyclo [9.4.1.0 <sup>1</sup>, <sup>14</sup>.0 <sup>4</sup>, <sup>9</sup>] hexadecan-7-yl 3-phenylprop-2-enoate.

    "title": "Effect of human platelet-rich fibrin lysate on collagen type I, collagen type III, and matrix metalloproteinase 1: a protocol study on rat models with pelvic organ prolapse.",
    "abstract": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent condition caused by weakened pelvic floor support structures. Extracellular matrix alterations, including changes in collagen type I, collagen type III, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. Human platelet-rich fibrin lysate (hPRF-L) is a novel regenerative treatment that has shown beneficial results in treating structural weaknesses related to various pelvic floor diseases, including POP. This study protocol aims to investigate the effects of hPRF-L injection on collagen I, III, and MMP-1 in the vaginal mucosa of a rat POP model. POP will be induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats, which will be randomly assigned to control, sham, and hPRF-L treatment groups. The hPRF-L group will receive weekly injections of hPRF-L (25, 50, or 75 μL) into the vaginal mucosa for 4 weeks. Vaginal tissue samples will be collected, and collagen type I, collagen type III, and MMP-1 expression will be evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. Data analysis will be performed with ANOVA and post-hoc tests. The findings from this study protocol are expected to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which hPRF-L impacts the structural integrity of the pelvic floor. By elucidating these mechanisms, this study aims to inform future POP treatment strategies. The anticipated results are an increase in collagen type I and III expression and a reduction in MMP-1 levels in the hPRF-L treatment group compared to the control and sham groups. These outcomes could support the use of hPRF-L as a regenerative therapy for managing POP, offering a potential alternative to more invasive surgical interventions. The expected results will contribute to the development of less invasive treatments for POP, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.",

    "title": "Comparison of Efficacy of 0.5% Ropivacaine Versus 2% Lignocaine Hydrochloride with Adrenaline (1:80,000) in Surgical Removal of Impacted Mandibular Third Molars with Emphasis on Depth of Anesthesia- Prospective, Randomized, Split Mouth Study.",
    "abstract": "A good anesthetic and analgesic effect is crucial for any minor surgical treatment to be successful. 2% Lignocaine hydrochloride with Adrenaline (1:80,000) is the most commonly used local anesthetic. However, it is not recommended for long procedures or in patients with cardiovascular diseases, where adrenaline is not desirable. Hence, need arises for a local anesthetic which has longer duration of action and adequate analgesic effect with minimal adverse reaction. 0.5% Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic with vasoconstrictive properties. It is considered to have superior properties compared to lignocaine in terms of duration of action and need for analgesics. This study compared the efficacy of 0.5% Ropivacaine versus 2% Lignocaine Hydrochloride with Adrenaline (1:80,000) in the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. A prospective, randomized, split mouth, cross over study was conducted amount 33 patients indicated for surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molar. Extraction of one side was done using 2% Lignocaine with Adrenaline (1:80,000) and the opposite side was extracted one week later using 0.5% Ropivacaine. Parameters assessed were, pain on injection, time of onset of the local anesthetic, the depth and duration of anesthesia, intensity of pain and need for analgesics postoperatively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of pain on injection. Time of onset was noted to be faster in the Lignocaine group. Ropivacaine was found to be superior to Lignocaine in terms of depth and duration of anesthesia and the postoperative analgesic effect. No adverse effect were noted in either of the two study groups. 0.5% Ropivacaine can be a suitable alternative to 2% Lignocaine in minor surgical procedures of long duration and in conditions, where the use of vasoconstrictor is contraindicated. It also provides an added benefit of greater depth of penetration into the bone along with a postoperative analgesic effect, thereby increasing the patient comfort. However, further study on a larger sample size is necessary to determine the overall effectiveness and practicality of using Ropivacine as an alternative to lignocaine in minor oral surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "The research objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using montelukast sodium alongside budesonide/formoterol in individuals with obstructive airway diseases. A prospective study was conducted on 100 obstructive airway disease patients who had received treatment of budesonide/formoterol inhalation powder (control group, <i>n</i> = 50) or montelukast sodium tablets supplemented to budesonide/formoterol inhalation powder (observation group, <i>n</i> = 50). Both groups underwent a 3-month treatment, and the assessment of effectiveness relied on symptom improvement, with a comparative analysis of outcomes for symptoms such as cough, sputum, wheezing, and dyspnoea. The evaluation involved measuring pulmonary function indicators like FEV1 and FEV1/FVC as well as comparing serum markers such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, eosinophils count, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide. With a total effective rate of 94.00%, the observation group showed a significant improvement in comparison to the control group, which achieved 80% effectiveness (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, the observation group experienced a significantly faster alleviation of symptoms such as cough, sputum, wheezing, and dyspnoea than the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Post-treatment, the observation group showed significantly better pulmonary function and lower inflammatory markers in comparison to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Notably, there was no significant variance in the occurrence of adverse reactions between groups. Montelukast sodium in conjunction with budesonide/formoterol presents a pronounced advantage in effectiveness and safety for treating obstructive airway diseases in individuals. It effectively alleviates symptoms, enhances pulmonary function, and diminishes inflammation, offering critical insights for clinical management.",

    "title": "Neural Networks or Linguistic Features? - Comparing Different Machine-Learning Approaches for Automated Assessment of Text Quality Traits Among L1- and L2-Learners' Argumentative Essays.",
    "abstract": "Recent investigations in automated essay scoring research imply that hybrid models, which combine feature engineering and the powerful tools of deep neural networks (DNNs), reach state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these findings are from holistic scoring tasks. In the present study, we use a total of four prompts from two different corpora consisting of both L1 and L2 learner essays annotated with trait scores (e.g., content, organization, and language quality). In our main experiments, we compare three variants of trait-specific models using different inputs: (1) models based on 220 linguistic features, (2) models using essay-level contextual embeddings from the distilled version of the pre-trained transformer BERT (DistilBERT), and (3) a hybrid model using both types of features. Results imply that when trait-specific models are trained based on a single resource, the feature-based models slightly outperform the embedding-based models. These differences are most prominent for the organization traits. The hybrid models outperform the single-resource models, indicating that linguistic features and embeddings indeed capture partially different aspects relevant for the assessment of essay traits. To gain more insights into the interplay between both feature types, we run addition and ablation tests for individual feature groups. Trait-specific addition tests across prompts indicate that the embedding-based models can most consistently be enhanced in content assessment when combined with morphological complexity features. Most consistent performance gains in the organization traits are achieved when embeddings are combined with length features, and most consistent performance gains in the assessment of the language traits when combined with lexical complexity, error, and occurrence features. Cross-prompt scoring again reveals slight advantages for the feature-based models.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to empirically test a comprehensive interrelationship between green supply chain management (GSCM), green technology innovation (GTI), waste management (WM), big data analytics capability powered by artificial intelligence (BDAC-AI), and their collective impact on sustainable performance (SP) in organizational contexts. This study was conducted in Pakistan's food processing sector. The respondents included 495 managers working in the food processing industry. A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach is used to examine direct and indirect relationships between the variables. The originality of this study lies in integration of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and dynamic capability theory (DCT) to understand sustainable practices in the context of the provided model. This study highlights that GSCM, GTI, WM, and BDAC-AI have positive, strong, and direct impacts on SP. Furthermore, GTI and WM only partially mediate the link between GSCM and SP, whereas the two moderate the link. In addition, BDAC-AI had a moderating effect on the relationship between GTI and SP. This study has managerial implications, including strategies that involve the use of theoretical frameworks for technological acceptance and dynamic capabilities to support sustainable initiatives. However, it is worth noting that the findings provide a practical contingency for managers and businesses interested in implementing green studies effectively, improving technologies, and strengthening sustainable performance capabilities. The study extends the literature by establishing a model for operationalizing GSCM in the food processing sector. Furthermore, it adds value in that it first integrates TAM and DCT to explain sustainable operations and their impact on organizations. Furthermore, it extends the existing literature by establishing a relationship between GSCM and SC. It offers a model through which GSCM can be operationalized in the context of the FS sector.",

    "abstract": "To analyze differential postoperative strength of masticatory muscles by surface electromyography (sEMG) in mandibular angle fractures (MAFs) using two open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) approaches. Present study evaluated the two ORIF approaches in unilateral non-comminuted central MAFs operated by intraoral ORIF (group A, <i>n</i> = 17) and extraoral ORIF (group B, <i>n</i> = 8). Root mean square (RMS) values of sEMG (<i>μ</i>V.s) of bilateral masseter and temporalis muscles for 10 s each, i.e., rest, maximum clenching, maximum mouth opening (MMO), ipsilateral and contralateral excursion, were compared from preoperative and postoperative visits at 1, 3 and 6 months. Further, MMO, ipsilateral and contralateral excursions were measured using caliper. No significant difference (<i>p</i> > 0.05) in sEMG of all four muscles during all five conditions between the groups was observed from pre-op to post-op 6 months. Post-op group A showed significantly higher MMO and statistically significant difference in sEMG of ipsilateral masseter (<i>p</i> = 0.017) and temporalis muscles (<i>p</i> = 0.019) compared to contralateral muscles at 1 month. When comparing percentage sEMG change from pre-op to 6 months, muscles of both groups revealed positive changes. The intraoral ORIF technique for MAFs shows early improvements in MMO and subsequent changes in sEMG of the masticatory muscles due to minimal muscle stripping, thus favoring its use in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "This experiment expands the findings from Abbey et al. (2021) by randomly assigning participants to one of three versions of a sexual aggression measure that differed only in the language used to convey lack of consent: (1) \"make her\"; (2) \"without her consent\"; or (3) \"when she didn't want to.\" Men between the ages of 18 and 35 (N = 1291) were recruited through a Qualtrics Panel for a study of their dating and sexual experiences with women. They completed demographics; validity indicators; and one randomly assigned version of the sexual aggression measure. Self-reported rates of sexual aggression were high across conditions. Participants who responded to questions that used \"make her\" language reported significantly higher rates of verbally coerced penetrative sex than did participants who responded to questions about sex \"without her consent\" or \"when she didn't want to.\" In contrast, self-reported rates of completed rape (i.e., physical force or incapacitation tactics), attempted rape, and nonpenetrative sexual contact did not significantly differ based on the language used to convey lack of consent. The magnitude of the correlations between the total number of sexually aggressive acts and convergent and discriminant validity measures was comparable regardless of the phrasing used to convey lack of consent. Tacit societal approval of the use of verbal pressure to obtain sex makes it difficult for people to recognize their own use of these tactics. Societal-level solutions are required to create a climate in which freely given consent is the norm.",

    "title": "Can Any Proximal Pole Scaphoid Fracture Nonunion be Treated with Arthroscopic Bone Grafting? A Series of Case Reports of Successes in Challenging and Unique Cases.",
    "abstract": "Due to the unique morphology and tenuous vascularity, proximal pole fractures of the scaphoid are prone to nonunion if neglected. The vascular anatomy and the understanding that the blood flow to the proximal pole is retrograde in nature, has supported the concept of disruption of blood flow to the proximal pole with the possibility of avascular necrosis in a nonunited proximal pole. Historically, surgical management at this stage has favored the use of a vascularized bone graft over a nonvascularized bone graft to achieve union and good outcomes. However, the current literature seems to deviate from the long-standing understanding of proximal pole nonunion and its relationship to avascular necrosis. Not only does it state that avascular necrosis is extremely rare, but it also advocates arthroscopic bone grafting of proximal pole nonunions using morselized nonvascularized bone graft which has been proven to be a highly successful operation. Here, in our paper, we present a short series of some unique but surgically challenging cases of proximal pole nonunion and our successful management by bone grafting and fixing them arthroscopically. Our experience and invariably the experience of many may indicate that arthroscopic bone grafting and fixation may be the correct choice of surgery for proximal pole nonunion of the scaphoid bone.",

The purpose of this study was to examine: (1) the factor structure and reliability of the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid (KSOG) and (2) measurement invariance across age and nativity groups. Participants included 454 Latina/o/x adolescents [25.3% Latina/o/x sexual minority youth (LSMY) and 74.7% Latina/o/x non-SMY]. We examined the hypothesized factor structure of the KSOG using confirmatory factor analysis and the configural, metric, and scalar invariance of the identified factor structure was examined between age (12-14 and 15-17) and nativity (U.S. born and foreign-born) groups. A single factor captured: identity, attraction, emotional connection, and fantasies (CFI/RMSEA=1.00/.000). We found evidence for metric noninvariance suggesting that sexual orientation as a latent construct does not perform equivalently among Hispanic adolescents who are younger versus older (Δχ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 106.01, <i>p</i> < 0.001, ΔCFI = 0.041, ΔTLI = 0.064, and ΔRMSEA = 0.154) or adolescents who are U.S. born versus foreign-born (Δχ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 10.34, <i>p</i> < 0.05, ΔCFI = 0.003, ΔTLI = 0.002, and ΔRMSEA = 0.011).

    "abstract": "Japanese philosopher Tanabe Hajime (1885-1962) not only discussed religion in ways that were rooted in the fundamental claims of his writings, such as Shinran in <i>Philosophy as Metanoetics</i> (1946), but he also made proposals on religion, as in <i>Demonstration of Christianity</i> (1948), where he advocated for the need for a \"second religious reformation.\" For Tanabe, philosophy and religion (along with science) are fused in a specific way, and it is possible to find a vision of religion to be aimed for that is worth considering as a theory of religion among Japanese philosophers. To examine the theory of religion of Tanabe, this study focuses on the work, <i>Demonstration of Christianity,</i> and other works from the perspective of religious studies. In <i>Demonstration of Christianity</i>, the concept of absolute religion toward the second religious reformation is envisioned based on Tanabe's dialectics of the absolute mediation, and a discussion on his world religion can be found, although it is limited to Christianity and some Buddhist sects. Reflecting his absolute dialectic, Tanabe says that this world religion was established through the absolute mediation of Christianity with \" <i>Nembutsu-Zen</i> \" (the unification of Pure Land Buddhism and Zen Buddhism). One cannot deny the impression of Christocentrism in these discussions, but they are in the result of Tanabe's thoroughness in philosophy. What can be drawn from these discussions is that Tanabe's theory of religion is strongly connected to Platonism, which he considered the root of his dialectics. For example, the third article in <i>Existence, Love, and Practice</i>(1947), \"Self-Transcendence in Platonism and Faith in Gospel.\" Tanabe's argument reveals the characteristics of conceiving a new religion that combines Buddhism and Christianity, philosophy, and religion through a creative interpretation of Platonism, the source of Western thought where philosophy and religion are inseparably linked.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic may be considered as a shared source of uncertainty. Prolonged engagement with social media regarding this uncertainty could present as a risk factor for anxiety. We sought to investigate the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty, dimensions of resilience, uncertainty source (pandemic)-related social media use, and the risk of anxiety and depression in patients with cancer. Patients with solid organ cancer (n=113) completed the sociodemographic data form, the Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12), the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) between May and August 2020. Depression scores were high at 17.7% of the patients while anxiety scores were high at 49.6%. RSA and its dimensions significantly differ between the Anxiety and Depression groups determined by the HADS. Time spent on social media about the COVID-19 pandemic (SMT) was associated with higher HADS-Anxiety scores (r=0.26, p<0.01), whereas higher resilience was associated with lower HADS- Anxiety (r=-0.42, p<0.01) and HADS-Depression (r=-0.52, p<0.01) scores. In addition to high levels of intolerance of uncertainty, low levels of the social resources were found to be a risk factor for depression, and low levels of self- and future-perception dimensions were found to be a risk factor for anxiety, regardless of the patients' social media use. As the factors that fuel uncertainty will always have an affect on cancer patients and cancer care, promoting the patients' resilience resources should be one of the main priorities for cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the structural and physicochemical properties of pea starch could be significantly affected by germination treatment, which can provide a theoretical basis for promoting the use of this starch in the food industry. This work aims to evaluate the effect of germination time on the structural, thermal, rheological and functional properties of pea starches to determine their potential in the production of fermented beverages. The physicochemical changes during the germination process of peas and native and germinated starch granules were evaluated. For germination critical time was 0.985 days, with 95% of germinated grains. The starch grains did not undergo any morphological change during the germination process as seen in the scanning electron microscopy images, indicating the absence of the α and ß - amylases responsible for the starch splitting. The X-ray patterns revealed that the crystalline structures of pea starch with and without germination were unchanged and contained by hexagonal and orthorhombic glucopyranose crystals. The viscosity profiles of the starches do not show significant changes; the most representative change is the increase in the gelatinization onset temperature of the paste from germinated starches compared to native starch. The functional properties of starches showed generally low values, with statistically significant differences between water absorption index, water solubility index, and starch swelling power and germination time. In general terms, it can be concluded that pea starch does not undergo significant changes in its physicochemical and functional integrity with respect to the grain germination process.",

    "abstract": "To report a rare case of uveal melanoma (UM) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome in a patient who underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify the possible genetic cause of the disease. A 54-year-old patient was referred to the eye clinic at the Rassoul Akram Hospital in 2016 due to complaints of blurry vision. In addition to UM, he later developed retinal capillary hemangioblastomas in his eye and a central nervous system hemangioblastoma. Proband had a family history of prostate cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. After analyzing the Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the VHL genes, no mutations were found, leading to the decision to perform WES. WES disclosed a heterozygous known pathogenic nonsense variant<i>:</i> c.274C>T (p.Arg92*) in exon 3 of gene <i>FCGR1A</i>. Our examination indicated that <i>FCGR1A</i>: c.274C>T (p.Arg92*) may have contributed to the co-occurrence of UM and VHL disease. In the future, <i>FCGR1A</i> could be a promising therapeutic approach for retinal cancer due to its role in several cancers and retinal degeneration. To gain a better understanding of its pathogenesis mechanism, it is recommended to conduct functional analysis using appropriate animal models before using the variant in genetic counseling.",

    "abstract": "To introduce a novel surgical technique for repositioning a dislocated XEN63<sup>®</sup> gel stent in patients with open-angle glaucoma, to synthesize contemporary findings on complications associated with stent dislocation, and to comment on related management strategies. A 75-year-old male with primary open-angle glaucoma experiencing XEN63 dislocation underwent this new surgical procedure. Key steps included identifying the scleral leakage site with Trypan Blue, performing precise scleral incisions, and careful stent repositioning. A mini-review on XEN dislocation was conducted through literature searches using PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on causes, complications, and management strategies. Relevant studies were selected based on specific inclusion criteria and a consensus process involving multiple reviewers. The technique successfully repositioned the stent, with postoperative recovery indicating normal intraocular pressure and correct stent positioning. Initial postsurgery assessments confirmed stent functionality and correct placement. Pathophysiological mechanisms related to dislocation, type of dislocation, and relative management was also presented summarizing the findings based on current literature. The study presents an effective, conservative management method for repositioning dislocated XEN63 gel stents using an ab externo approach. This technique offers a less traumatic alternative to current practices by avoiding the need for additional devices or scleral pocket creation. The accompanying mini-review provides a comprehensive overview of XEN dislocation, enhancing the strategy for managing such complications. Further research, including broader case series or comparative studies, is essential to solidify these findings.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that self-harm-related mental imagery is involved in the transition from self-harm ideation to enactment. However, there has been little research on this important phenomenon in adolescent populations. Using an online questionnaire, the frequency, content and impact of self-harm-related mental imagery was investigated in a transdiagnostic clinical population of young people with recent self-harm. Mood ratings were used to assess the impact of completing the questionnaire. Fifty-five young people aged 14-24 years old completed the study. Participants were mostly female (85.5%) and White (87.3%). All but one participant (98.2%) reported images related to self-harm, with 53 (96.4%) reporting future-oriented self-harm images, 53 (96.4%) reporting past-oriented images, and 52 (94.5%) reporting both. Imagery included imagining self-harm and particularly dangerous acts (including suicide), specific methods, and the consequences of self-harm for self and others. Past self-harm-related mental imagery was sometimes used to develop future-oriented self-harm-related imagery planning, highlighting the influence of previous exposure to self-harm. Most participants (<i>N</i> = 45; 88.2%) stated that significant self-harm-related mental imagery increased the likelihood they would self-harm. Stimulation of mental imagery was most frequently reported to be related to dreams about self-harm (<i>N</i> = 33; 60.0%), and exposure to self-harm-related content on social media (<i>N</i> = 32; 58.2%) and in fictional TV programmes (<i>N</i> = 30; 54.6%). There was no significant difference in participants' pre- and post-questionnaire mood ratings. Self-harm-related mental imagery is commonly experienced by young people who self-harm and may play a role in ideation-to-enactment of self-harm. Asking about self-harm-related mental imagery can be done safely and could be considered for inclusion in routine clinical assessments. Self-harm exposure and the origins of self-harm-related imagery, such as the links with past self-harm and social media, as well as potential imagery-based interventions for self-harm, require further evaluation. A working model of self-harm-related mental imagery is presented.",

    "abstract": "Maxillofacial trauma is becoming an increasing issue in Indian states, and fractures in the mandibular parasymphysis region are the most common. Standard treatment modality is open reduction and internal fixation but even that is not spared from complications. Corticosteroid administration locally has grown in favor; intramuscular injections of the drug close to the surgical site have been found to reduce postoperative edema. Despite being simple to apply, it may result in soft tissue dehiscence. In contrast, Vitamin C offers a promising substitute for improving the healing process when given submucosally. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the postoperative wound healing, swelling, and pain in patients receiving local intramuscular injections of dexamethasone alone versus those receiving a combination of dexamethasone and Vitamin C. A total of 30 patients participated in study. Participants were divided into two groups by random allocation. Intraoperatively, injection dexamethasone was injected in one group into the mentalis muscle. In the second group, injection Vitamin C was injected submucosally near the suture line along with injection dexamethasone. Present study showed that there was a significant reduction in facial swelling in both groups along with reduction in postoperative pain. Intergroup comparison showed that soft tissue wound healing was better in patients who received Vitamin C injections. Vitamin C promotes the collagen synthesis which counteracts the degrading effect of dexamethasone on the soft tissues. Hence, the use of dexamethasone in combination with Vitamin C in management of mandibular parasymphysis fracture is recommended.

    "title": "Assessing Complications and Outcomes of Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous Flap in Head and Neck Oncology: Insights from 150 Cases.",
    "abstract": "Reconstruction after tumor removal in the head and neck region presents a challenge for balancing functionality and aesthetics. The pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (PMMC) is a reliable option for post-tumor resection reconstruction. However, complications such as flap necrosis, detachment, donor site tumor recurrence, wound infections, and wound dehiscence have been encountered in 150 cases where PMMC was utilized. This retrospective study focuses on analyzing the complications and experiences associated with using PMMC in head and neck oncology. This analysis looks back at 150 cases of head and neck oncology that underwent PMMC flap reconstruction. Of these cases, 128 (85.3%) involved buccal mucosa reconstruction, while 22 (14.7%) focused on the tongue, floor of the mouth, and neck. Out of the total 150 cases, 141 cases (94%) were male, and 9 cases (6%) were female. We carefully documented any complications, paying specific attention to flap necrosis, detachment, donor site tumor recurrence, flap retraction, oro-cutaneous fistula, wound infections, and wound dehiscence. The study result concluded following complications were encountered, and there were instances of flap necrosis observed in 9 cases (6%). Additionally, 16 cases (10.7%) experienced flap detachment, which impacted postoperative recovery and necessitated further interventions, and 11 cases (7.3%) had flap retraction. Three cases (2%) exhibited tumor recurrence at the donor site following PMMC flap harvesting. Wound infections were prevalent, affecting 13 patients (8.6%). Two patients (1.3%) experienced donor site wound dehiscence postoperatively, and five patients (3.3%) had oro-cutaneous fistula. The use of PMMC flaps in head and neck oncology requires careful consideration, surgical expertise, and postoperative care to minimize complications. Although it has been historically significant and useful, advanced surgical techniques and postoperative care protocols are necessary to optimize outcomes in PMMC flap reconstructions. Therefore, meticulous patient selection and vigilant postoperative care are essential for addressing and minimizing complications.",

    "abstract": "Assessing adolescent sexual identity is complicated, and contemporary sexual identities are gaining greater complexity and variation. However, current measures do not capture the diversity of contemporary identities among adolescents. Thus, our study utilized a large national dataset of sexual minority adolescents aged 14-17 years (<i>N</i> = 2,558) in the United States to propose a taxonomy of sexual identities among adolescents. Participants responded to a close-ended sexual identity question, followed by an open-ended qualitative question. Using the steps outlined in content analysis procedures, two researchers independently coded the open-ended responses, which were then discussed to establish consensus. Coding of open-ended responses to the sexual identity question resulted in 8 categories, with more than 25% of adolescents identifying with less common sexual identity labels. We further tested differences in sexual identity among responses to the close-ended question, sociodemographic characteristics, and mental health outcomes using chi-square and analysis of variance tests. We found overall differences in sexual identification by close-ended responses, age, and assigned sex at birth. However, we did not find any difference in sexual identity by race and ethnicity or urbanicity. We also found differences in sexual identity by mental health symptoms and suicidal outcomes, especially among respondents who identified with less common sexual identity labels. Findings from our study provide cutting-edge information on sexual identities that better captures the current state of adolescent sexual identity classification in the U.S. Future research should employ this taxonomy of eight sexual identity categories to collect data that reflect contemporary evidence.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess the associations of the severity of different symptom dimensions and psychosis risk factors with the overall functioning levels in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients over a 6-month follow-up period. Psychosis symptom dimensions (positive, negative, depression, mania, attention and other cognitive), sociodemographic characteristics and environmental risk factors (alcohol-substance use, childhood traumas, current stressful life events) were prospectively assessed in 32 patients who were hospitalized for FEP during the six-month follow-up period. The associations of these variables with the longitudinal Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores of these patients were analyzed using linear regression or repeated measures ANOVA. The severity of positive, negative, depression and mania dimensions reduced (p<0.001) during the follow-up period, while no significant change was found in Stroop interference effect scores (F=0.4, p=0.53). FEP patients with substance or alcohol use had significantly worse functioning during the follow-up period (F=11.2, p=0.001; F=5.3, p=0.02, respectively), and those patients' functioning improved significantly less (F=10.0, p=0.002; F=4.3; p=0.04, respectively). Stroop test performance detected at the first month of the follow-up period significantly predicted the final general functioning scores of the follow- up [Stroop test word reading time (sec): B=-0.58 (-1.13-0.03); color telling speed (sec): B=-0.35 (-0.59-0.1); interference effect: B=-0.28 (-0.57-0.01)]. The stable course and prognostic value of attention and other types of cognitive functioning in FEP patients is remarkable. Interventions for alcohol-substance use in FEP patients should be a part of routine practice.",

    "abstract": "ELIXIR is a pan-European public-funded research infrastructure dedicated to life science data. As such, it must demonstrate public value to its funders and stakeholders. We present methods to inventory research publications linked to ELIXIR that have received funding and support, as well as related citation metrics, used as performance metrics for these audiences. To overcome challenges inherent in ELIXIR's distributed structure, and the fact that those publishing ELIXIR-supported work are typically working part-time on ELIXIR matters, a semi-automated approach, consisting of text-mining followed by manual curation, is presented. A country-level case study (ELIXIR Italy) refines and expands the methods, notably by introducing more granularity in the curation process (e.g. considering all national-level grants, examining affiliations to report publication per institute) and by additionally looking at the scientific impact of the resources developed and operated by the Italian Node of ELIXIR. Overall, the methods described in this article have shown to: (1) be repeatable with acceptable levels of accuracy and consistency (notably across curators); (2) require reasonable effort in terms of curation of monthly 'harvests' of publications (obtained by text-mining); and (3) to be well-adapted to ELIXIR's distributed nature. Concrete examples are provided of downstream uses of the inventoried publications and their citations, both for ELIXIR as a whole and for the Italian case study. Limitations of the methods are discussed, particularly the challenges associated with using an 'Open literature' database (Europe PMC) for the text-mining, and the constraints related to curation capacity. The methods, along with the valuable lessons learned during their development, are sufficiently generic and pragmatic enough to be readily adapted by other similar research infrastructures.",

Patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, then biweekly until complete retinal vascularization. Efficacy was evaluated based on disease activity regression (plus disease regression) and complete retinal vascularization. Safety was assessed through the monitoring of adverse events such as uveitis and endophthalmitis. Forty-four infants were included in the study. The mean age at IVB injection was 34.5 weeks. Complete retinal vascularization occurred at a mean age of 60.02 weeks for Stivant<sup>®</sup> and 59.93 weeks for Avastin<sup>®</sup> (<i>P</i> = 0.59). Five patients (11.3%) underwent bilateral laser photocoagulation as rescue treatment. Our results showed that Stivant<sup>®</sup> was noninferior to Avastin<sup>®</sup> in retinal vascularization progress. However, this study cannot make definitive noninferiority claims due to the sample size and its design as a pilot investigation. No cases of endophthalmitis or uveitis were reported.

    "abstract": "For efficient human-robot interaction, human operators need to be able to efficiently represent the robot's movements in space and predict its next steps. However, according to frameworks of Bayesian multisensory integration, features outside the motion itself-like the sounds a robot makes while it moves-should affect how otherwise identical motions are perceived. Here, we translate an established psychophysical task from experimental psychology to a human-robot interaction context, which can measure these distortions to motion perception. In two series of preregistered studies, participants watched a humanoid robot make forward and backward reaching movements. When the robot hand suddenly disappeared, they reported its last seen location, either with the mouse cursor (Experiment 1a and 1b) or by matching it to probe stimuli in different locations (Experiment 2a and 2b). The results revealed that even small changes to the robot's sound robustly affect participants' visuospatial representation of its motions, so that the motion appeared to extend further in space when accompanied by slightly (100 ms) longer sounds compared to slightly shorter sounds (100 ms shorter). Moreover, these sound changes do not only affect where people currently locate the robot's motion, but where they anticipate its future steps. These findings show that sound design is an effective medium for manipulating how people represent otherwise identical robot actions and coordinate its interactions with it. The study acts as proof of concept that psychophysical tasks provide a promising tool to measure how design parameters influence the perception and prediction of robot motion.

    "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions (SD) are very common in patients with psychiatric disorders and may be due to the side effects of the disease or medications used. Current scales cannot distinguish whether SDs are due to psychiatric illness or medications use. The Psychotropic Associated Sexual Dysfunction Questionnaire (PRSexDQ) is a customized scale for screening SD due to drug use. Our aim is to conduct a validity and reliability study of PRSexDQ in patients using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). One hundred patients who applied to psychiatry outpatient clinic and received SSRI treatment for at least 1 month were included in the study. These patients were evaluated by a psychiatrist, and completed the PRSexDQ-T, Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), Golombok Rust Inventory Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS). The Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was calculated as 0.906 for the analysis performed to evaluate the internal consistency of the PRSexDQ-T. In the item-total score analysis, the correlation of all items with the total score was found to be quite high (above 0.7). Correlation coefficients were found between 0.939 and 0.985, which was used to determine the test-retest correlation for each item, and all values were statistically significant (p<0.01). In the Pearson correlation analysis performed for validity analysis, a large positive correlation was found between PRSexDQ-T and ASEX and GRISS male-female total and subscale scores. The Turkish version of PRSexDQ is a valid and reliable measurement tool in the sample of patients using SSRIs to evaluate the level of sexual dysfunction.",

    "title": "Intraoperative Detection of Screw Penetration Following Volar Plating of the Distal Radius: A Cadaveric Study Comparing Fluoroscopic Imaging and Ultrasound.",
    "abstract": "Hardware prominence is one of the major established complications following volar plating of distal radius fractures. The purpose of this cadaveric study is to compare two conventional fluoroscopic imaging views (carpal shoot-through view [CSV] and dorsal horizon view [DHV]) with ultrasound (US) to establish the best intraoperative imaging modality for surgeons to use to identify penetration of screws through the dorsal cortex and/or into the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Twelve human cadaveric limbs were included in the study, instrumented with distal radius plates via a volar approach. The three imaging modalities, CSV, DHV, and US, were compared in terms of detecting prominent screws during volar plate fixation. Six surgeons with varying levels of expertise performed the evaluations. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were computed for every surgeon and imaging method. The CSV was found to be more sensitive compared with the DHV and US for detecting dorsal cortex penetration (99% vs. 94% vs. 56%, respectively). The DHV was found to be more sensitive in recognizing DRUJ screw penetration compared with CSV and US (89% vs. 78% vs. 11%, respectively). US evaluation demonstrated considerably lower diagnostic utility compared with CSV and DHV. Surgeon's ability to perform as well as confidence in evaluating for screw penetration was highest with the CSV view. Fluoroscopic imaging, particularly the CSV, demonstrates greater diagnostic reliability compared with US for intraoperative detection of prominent screws following volar plate fixation of the distal radius. CSV was also identified as the most reproducible examination for all levels of expertise with minimal formal training required. Therapeutic level V.",

    "abstract": "Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) comprises <1% of all head and neck cancers but has one of the highest 5-year mortalities. A systematic review and analysis using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses) guidelines was conducted on SNMM survival, recurrence, and prognostic factors. A total of 2,379 abstracts were reviewed resulting in 90 studies describing 3347 SNMM patients. Patients were 49.65% male and 66.5 years old. Surgery plus radiation therapy, followed by surgery only, then radiation only were the most common treatments. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy were used in 418 patients and 101 respectively. The 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals are 55.97, 40.09, and 30.35%, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival and disease-specific survival are 25.56 and 38.04%. The 5-year local, regional, and distant recurrence-free survivals are 42.35, 81.64, and 44.65%. Mean survival after diagnosis was 26.99 months. Local ( <i>n</i>  = 650), regional ( <i>n</i>  = 226), and distant ( <i>n</i>  = 723) failure presented after 19.36, 6.35, and 12.42 months. Sites of metastasis were lung, liver, bone, brain, skin, kidney, and adrenal glands. Distant metastases, disease in the paranasal sinuses, and higher stage were noted to have worse survival outcomes. Positive margins did not significantly impact overall survival in 11/12 studies. Overall survival over 20 years has remained poor with 70% of patients deceased in 5 years. About half of patients will develop distant failure and will thereafter rapidly decline. These data indicate need for advances in treatment of SNMM and new efforts with targeted immunotherapy offer a promising avenue toward improving survival outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Hematological systemic inflammatory markers have been used in predicting the severity and prognosis of the disease in recent years. We aimed to determine the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in the prediction of composite adverse outcomes (CAO) in peripartum hemorrhage requiring fibrinogen administration. This retrospective cohort study was conducted with pregnant women who were treated with perioperative fibrinogen concentrate in the Department of Perinatology, Ministry of Health Ankara City Hospital between January 01, 2023 and June 01, 2023. NLR (neutrophil/lymphocyte), PLR (platelet/lymphocyte), and SII (NLR x platelet count) were calculated using the complete blood cell count at the first hospital admission. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence (<i>n</i> = 31) or absence (<i>n</i> = 60) of a composite adverse outcome. NLR, PLR, and SII values were compared between the two subgroups. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the performance of complete blood cell indices to predict CAOs. Statistically significantly higher values for NLR, PLR, and SII were observed in the CAO group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Optimal cut-off values were 774.42 (70.5% sensitivity, 47.7% specificity, <i>p</i> < 0.001), 103.09 (78.7% sensitivity, 53.3% specificity, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and 3.33 (73.8% sensitivity, 50% specificity, <i>p</i> < 0.001), for Sİİ, PLR, and NLR, respectively. NLR, PLR and SII are non-invasive, low-cost, simple and repeatable indices. These indices could help clinicians identify patients at high-risk for CAO in severe postpartum hemorrhage and customise individualised therapeutic regimens.",

    "title": "Community boat service to promote institutional delivery in the Philippines: a mixed-methods study of a social innovation.",
    "abstract": "Remote islands have limited access to institutional obstetric care, and these challenges are further exacerbated by climatic threats. A Health Service Boat Project was implemented in rural Philippines to provide free boats for pregnant people to deliver at facilities and facilitate prenatal outreach. To evaluate the impact of the boat project on institutional delivery rates and to explore the underlying mechanism. A sequential mixed-methods study was conducted in Zumarraga Municipality, Philippines. In the quantitative component, we analysed the data from nationally representative household surveys and governmental data to assess the institutional delivery rate before and after the boat project started in 2012. Linear difference-in-difference regression analysis was used to test the intervention effects of the boat project on institutional delivery. Weather information obtained from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration was used to compare the institutional delivery rate between cyclone-affected and non-cyclone-affected periods. In the qualitative component, we conducted two focus group discussions and two semistructured interviews to explore how the boat service may have improved the institutional delivery rate. The institutional delivery rate significantly increased the year after the boat project started (B=0.38, p<0.001). The median institutional delivery rate during the cyclone-affected period was significantly lower than that during the non-cyclone-affected period but still remained high at 93.3%. Pregnant women who used the boat service to facilitate institutional delivery reported that they trusted the service, which was available regardless of economic status and political affiliations. The boat project also allowed community health workers to conduct more frequent prenatal check-ups in the community, leading to an improved rapport between health workers and women. The main challenge identified during the implementation was the limited budget for long-term maintenance of the boat. The boat project not only facilitated transportation for pregnant people to the facility but also improved community-based prenatal services. In addition, the boat project may mitigate some of the effects of cyclones on access to health services for pregnant people.",

    "title": "Comparing perch availability and perch use between African dwarf chameleon (<i>Bradypodion</i>) ecomorphs.",
    "abstract": "Adaptation to different environments can lead to local adaptations that facilitate morphological divergence between closely related taxa, potentially leading to speciation. Quantifying habitat variation can thus provide valuable insights into evolutionary processes. Arboreal dwarf chameleons of the genus <i>Bradypodion</i> exhibit 3 distinct ecomorphological forms: forest, shrub, and \"little brown chameleons\" (LBCs). It is assumed these ecomorphs are the result of convergence among species that are in similar habitats regardless of ancestry, or in some cases, morphological conservatism and retention of an ancestral form that is adapted to a shared habitat type. If so, then the habitat of different ecomorphs would differ in vegetation structure. Our results show that vegetation structure in fynbos/grassy habitats is characterized by significantly narrower perches than shrubby habitats, but both have a largely vertical perch orientation. In contrast, forests have significantly fewer vertical perches than fynbos/grassy habitats with significantly thicker diameter perches. Accordingly, LBC and shrub species used more vertically oriented perches than forest species, suggesting that perch use corresponds with the most widely available perch angles. Although LBC chameleons used the smallest diameter perches, when corrected for body size, there was no difference in perch diameter among ecomorphs. These results suggest that the body size of LBC chameleons is constrained by the prevalence of small-diameter perches in their habitat. Species in habitats with wider perches attain larger body size. These findings support the notion that variation in perch structure is critical for phenotypic convergence that has resulted in the 3 <i>Bradypodion</i> ecomorphs.",

    "title": "Enhancing Robotic Collaborative Tasks Through Contextual Human Motion Prediction and Intention Inference.",
    "abstract": "Predicting human motion based on a sequence of past observations is crucial for various applications in robotics and computer vision. Currently, this problem is typically addressed by training deep learning models using some of the most well-known 3D human motion datasets widely used in the community. However, these datasets generally do not consider how humans behave and move when a robot is nearby, leading to a data distribution different from the real distribution of motion that robots will encounter when collaborating with humans. Additionally, incorporating contextual information related to the interactive task between the human and the robot, as well as information on the human willingness to collaborate with the robot, can improve not only the accuracy of the predicted sequence but also serve as a useful tool for robots to navigate through collaborative tasks successfully. In this research, we propose a deep learning architecture that predicts both 3D human body motion and human intention for collaborative tasks. The model employs a multi-head attention mechanism, taking into account human motion and task context as inputs. The resulting outputs include the predicted motion of the human body and the inferred human intention. We have validated this architecture in two different tasks: collaborative object handover and collaborative grape harvesting. While the architecture remains the same for both tasks, the inputs differ. In the handover task, the architecture considers human motion, robot end effector, and obstacle positions as inputs. Additionally, the model can be conditioned on the desired intention to tailor the output motion accordingly. To assess the performance of the collaborative handover task, we conducted a user study to evaluate human perception of the robot's sociability, naturalness, security, and comfort. This evaluation was conducted by comparing the robot's behavior when it utilized the prediction in its planner versus when it did not. Furthermore, we also applied the model to a collaborative grape harvesting task. By integrating human motion prediction and human intention inference, our architecture shows promising results in enhancing the capabilities of robots in collaborative scenarios. The model's flexibility allows it to handle various tasks with different inputs, making it adaptable to real-world applications.",

Two years post-AGV surgery in both eyes, a 3-year-old aniridic female presented with grayish discoloration of the right eye for the past 3 months. A slit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed an aniridic, hypotonic eye with a totally edematous cornea. A tube of the AGV was in place with a mature cataract subluxed superiorly. In addition, a thick, whitish vascularized membrane originating from the rudimentary iris to the inferior part of the subluxed lens was observed. Ultrasound biomicroscopy investigation confirmed a thick fibrotic membrane originating from the iris root and extending to the posterior part of the cataractous lens. The intraocular pressure of the right and left eye was 0 and 11 mmHg, respectively. A B-scan of the right eye revealed an axial length of 21 mm, optic disc swelling, and shallow choroidal detachment in the anterior 2/3 of the posterior segment without retinal detachment. With the diagnosis of AFS, a pars plana vitrectomy, lensectomy, and membranectomy under keratoprosthesis and penetrating keratoplasty were planned. Aniridic patients may undergo multiple ocular surgeries during their lifetime. One of the rarest surgical complications in these patients is AFS. Early diagnosis can be possible with serial slit-lamp examination and ultrasonographic studies to detect the disease in the early stages and prompt intervention. Here, in our case, the parents declined any surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathy is common in both Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Leprosy, often resulting in neuropathic ulcers. Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers are frequently misdiagnosed as DM-related, causing delays in appropriate care. We report a case which had been misdiagnosed at three different healthcare centers before receiving the correct diagnosis and management. The case report adopt the CARE Guidelines and was conducted at the Wound Care Specialist Clinic. Data were collected using a Minimum Data Set (MDS) to capture demographics, health history, and history of treatments. A head-to-toe assessment focused on the eyes, hands, and feet, with neuropathy, confirmed using the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament test, and angiopathy was assessed by palpating the dorsal pedis and posterior tibialis pulse. Wound care interventions consisted of cleansing, debridement, and dressing. Given the similarities between Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers and DM-related neuropathic ulcers, the DMIST (depth, maceration, inflammation/infection, size, tissue type of the wound bed, type of wound edge, and tunnelling/undermining) tool was used to evaluate wound healing progress. Anamnesis indicated patient has no DM, with normal blood glucose; however, the patient had neuropathic wounds on her feet, asymmetrical eyebrow distribution, and rashes on her hands and calves, with neuropathy confirmed by a monofilament test-initial treatment involved Cadexomer Iodine powder to control bacterial growth and Honey-based gel to promote granulation. Over 62 days, 11 treatments were administered, with an average dressing change every 5.6 days, which improved the DMIST score from 12 to 4 by the end of observation day. This case report highlights the significance of distinguishing leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers from those associated with DM to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. By employing comprehensive assessment tools and targeted wound care interventions, significant improvements in wound healing were achieved, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and clinical vigilance in managing Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers.",

    "abstract": "Young transgender adults report higher levels of mental health difficulties compared to the general population. These difficulties reportedly improve following gender-affirming care and transition. However, gender-dysphoric people wait up to 5+ years in the UK to access gender-affirming treatment. The study aimed to qualitatively explore the psychological challenges and impact of waiting to access UK Gender Dysphoria Clinics (GDCs) for young trans adults. Recruitment <i>via</i> two GDCs resulted in a sample of 10 participants (aged 17-26) who had been waiting at least 12 months for assessment. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted online or by phone with four men, four women, and two gender nonconforming people. Data were analyzed through Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Challenges and impact of waiting were represented within eight themes. Five psychosocial challenges included \"Grasping on a spider web of hope that's about to snap,\" \"People are uneducated and they don't understand,\" \"Society or whatever made me second guess myself,\" \"I'm too autistic for that shit', and \"It sounded like the phone was just being left all day every day.\" Mental health impacts of waiting were captured in the themes \"(Gender) Dysphoria attacks\" and \"If it doesn't go well by 30, I'm gonna kill myself.\" A final theme, \"I'm going to just go on with me life,\" focused on healthy and less-adaptive coping strategies. Waiting to access GDCs is a fragile and vulnerable time; experiences of discrimination, stigma, transphobia, and uncertainty during the waiting period appear to increase feelings of hopelessness and diminish mental health. Focusing on social transitioning was reported by most participants as a coping strategy for waiting. Findings highlight the importance of reducing waiting times for GDCs and offering psychosocial support during the wait.",

    "abstract": "Good care and conscious, mindful parenting are the essential requirements of the early childhood period. Good care in early childhood consists of mindful handling of children's needs like hunger, care in sickness, socio-emotional needs, safety, love and affection. Good care promotes children's development and provides a favourable environment for learning. It's a well-known fact that hospitalization is a stressful situation for child of any age. Play is an integral part of early childhood period which is virtually restricted in hospital settings. This study will try to explore the effectiveness of play therapy delivered in hospital settings, on early child development (ECD). This will be a randomized control trial conducted in the Paediatrics department of a tertiary care hospital in Wardha, India. The sample size will be 360 children, 180 each in intervention and control arm. The hospitalized children from intervention arm will receive customized Play Therapy sessions from trained research assistants and will be followed up at scheduled monthly home visits for one year from the date of enrolment. All children will be assessed for changes in cognitive, motor and socio-emotional development scores. The differences in development scores between intervention and control groups will be compared and effect sizes of changes will be calculated. Implementation of play stimulation activities have been reported as useful strategies for promoting child development and good recovery during hospitalization. This trial will attempt to explore the effectiveness of play therapy on changes in child development scores of children from intervention group compared to the control group. The customized play therapy program will be adapted to paediatric inpatient settings, and attempts will be made to improve the Play Therapy kit for hospitalized children.

    "title": "Children's Emotion Regulation and Subjective Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Intergenerational Perspective Among Racially and Economically Minoritized Mother-Child Dyads in the United States.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted family life, with disproportionate impacts on families who are racially and economically marginalized. Decades of developmental research emphasize how caregivers' <i>or</i> children's emotional responses to stressors shape children's post-exposure adaptation. Less work has examined the intersection of parents' <i>and</i> children's lived experiences of the pandemic, and their co-contribution to children's adaptation. The study's goal was to examine both COVID-related and lifetime stressors and their associations with maternal perception of children's emotional regulation and distress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a sample of 72 mothers and their children (M = 7.94 years) who are American, low-income, and predominantly Black, we examined whether parent-reported maternal and child factors co-contributed to children's emotion regulation and COVID-related distress. Between November 2020-March 2021, mothers reported on their emotion regulation difficulties, their child's emotion regulation, their child's lifetime exposure to stressors, their child's exposure to COVID-specific stressors, and their own and their child's perception of COVID-related disruptions as distressing. Our results parse differential predictors: children's lifetime stressor exposure and maternal emotion regulation difficulties predicted children's emotion regulation; children's exposure to COVID-related stressors, maternal subjective COVID-related stress, and maternal emotion regulation difficulties predicted children's subjective COVID-related stress. Although limited by reliance on parent report, findings highlight the importance of considering children's experiences of distress and emotion regulation during the COVID-19 pandemic in broader contexts, including the context of parent's own regulatory capacities and perceptions of stress, as well as children's lifetime experiences of stressors.",

    "title": "Contributors to concentrated poverty of Blacks and Hispanics in metropolitan America, 1980-2020.",
    "abstract": "A longstanding debate asks why African Americans have been disproportionately concentrated in poor neighborhoods. All sides agree that a key contributor is the high level of poverty among Blacks, but they differ on other sources. Has the exodus of a growing Black middle class from the inner city (raising income segregation among Blacks) left the Black poor more isolated? Does persistent high racial segregation hold both middle class and poor Blacks in neighborhoods that are depressed by the high rate of Black poverty? Is poverty in Black neighborhoods mainly due to the presence of poor Black households or poor non-Black neighbors? This study addresses these questions with data for 1980-2020, and extends the analysis also to the case of Hispanic poverty exposure. Longitudinal models and detailed analysis of neighborhood composition by race and income show that the group's own income composition is the most important predictor of poverty exposure. This effect is compounded by high racial segregation. Within-group income segregation adds to poverty concentration for Blacks but not for Hispanics. Blacks and Hispanics of all income levels live in poorer neighborhoods mainly because of the large share of their Black and Hispanic low-income neighbors, while their white neighbors tend to have higher incomes than they do.",

It also assessed the patients' satisfaction with the amount of information provided to them and their involvement in treatment decisions. Additionally, the study evaluated differences between patients' and their companions' perspectives on the necessity of informing patients about their health status. This cross-sectional study included 110 eligible patients, who were interviewed using a developed and validated questionnaire. The results revealed that Iranian patients exhibited a relatively high tendency to seek information and participate in medical decision-making. This tendency was more pronounced among women, married individuals, and patients hospitalized in private hospitals. Additionally, the companions' inclination to inform patients about their clinical condition was lower than the patients' own desire to be informed. The study concluded that doctors should create an appropriate environment for informing patients and facilitating their active participation in decisions. Furthermore, the decision regarding the extent of information provided to patients should be left to the patients themselves.",

    "abstract": "Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is a rare form of internal male pseudohermaphroditism in phenotypically males with 46 XY karyotype. The syndrome is caused by insufficient amount of Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) or due to insensitivity of the target organ to MIS. Till date, less than 300 cases of PMDS are described in English literature, and the association of testicular tumor is still rarer. We report a case of seminoma of testis with PMDS in a 22-year male who reported with intermittent pain, fullness, and dragging sensation over right-side lower abdomen for 4 years. The radiological impression was testicular mass arising from undescended testis with persistent Mullerian duct structures. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis. Association of undescended testis increases the likelihood of developing testicular tumor in PMDS. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware of the rare entity while dealing with the cryptorchidism with inguinal hernia, and necessary management should be done to reduce the complications.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) could be a useful tool for lawyers. However, empirical research on their effectiveness in conducting legal tasks is scant. We study securities cases involving cryptocurrencies as one of numerous contexts where AI could support the legal process, studying GPT-3.5's legal reasoning and ChatGPT's legal drafting capabilities. We examine whether a) GPT-3.5 can accurately determine which laws are potentially being violated from a fact pattern, and b) whether there is a difference in juror decision-making based on complaints written by a lawyer compared to ChatGPT. We feed fact patterns from real-life cases to GPT-3.5 and evaluate its ability to determine correct potential violations from the scenario and exclude spurious violations. Second, we had mock jurors assess complaints written by ChatGPT and lawyers. GPT-3.5's legal reasoning skills proved weak, though we expect improvement in future models, particularly given the violations it suggested tended to be correct (it merely missed additional, correct violations). ChatGPT performed better at legal drafting, and jurors' decisions were not statistically significantly associated with the author of the document upon which they based their decisions. Because GPT-3.5 cannot satisfactorily conduct legal reasoning tasks, it would be unlikely to be able to help lawyers in a meaningful way at this stage. However, ChatGPT's drafting skills (though, perhaps, still inferior to lawyers) could assist lawyers in providing legal services. Our research is the first to systematically study an LLM's legal drafting and reasoning capabilities in litigation, as well as in securities law and cryptocurrency-related misconduct.",

    "abstract": "Team adaptation is particularly impactful within extreme and isolated environments, where sudden and abrupt events drastically challenge effective teamwork. To advance the team adaptation literature, we examined how event characteristics influence the relationship between team adaptation processes and team adaptive performance. To do so, we conducted an on-site, multi-study research using sequential explanatory mixed methods and a retrospective event history approach. The first study (based on a quantitative multilevel methodology) was designed to understand how the characteristics of the events influenced team adaptation processes and team adaptive performance (we collected data of 86 events described by 56 informants nested within 21 teams) during one Antarctic Summer Campaign at the South Shetland Islands Archipelago, Antarctica. The second study, based on qualitative methodology focused on thematic analysis, was designed to obtain a detailed description of the relationship between adaptation triggers and team adaptation (we collected data from 20 semi-structured interviews). Overall, our findings highlight that different team processes are significant in shaping perceptions of team adaptive performance, making the modification of transition and interpersonal processes the most critical. We additionally show how these relationships are moderated by the characteristics of adaptation triggers. We discuss the implications of these findings for teams within extreme environments and beyond.",

    "title": "Researcher identities and values in the impact agenda: the case of artificial intelligence academics.",
    "abstract": "A major shift in the research sector has been the increased expectation from policymakers and funders that academic research should yield some socioeconomic benefits or 'impacts' rather than merely new knowledge. In this paper, we explore the role that impact has in academics' motivations and values and how impact is being integrated into academics' core functions of research and education. We do this through in-depth interviews (<i>n</i> = 60) with scientists who work on the development or application of artificial intelligence (AI), broadly defined. This AI's focus situates our participants within a strategically important, high-priority area of research for all three national contexts included in our study-Australia, the UK and the USA. Our findings reveal that the impact mission has become central to understanding the motivations and values of academics, but unevenly. We identify divergence between those who work on AI from a foundational computer science perspective and those who develop and apply AI within other scientific domains. The two groups have different understandings of key notions such as 'impact' and 'applied research', as well as different ways of integrating the impact agenda into their research and education activities. The study highlights the importance of flexible approaches to research policy and governance that are based on a deeper understanding of what motivates researchers, and that take into account academics' educational role. Greater holistic understanding of how academic identities and practices are accommodating the impact agenda is essential to maximise synergy across activities and avoid unintended consequences.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objectives</b>  This study aims to fill in the knowledge gap about patients with occipital condyle fractures (OCFs) and cranial nerve dysfunction (CND) and give advice about when to test the cranial nerves (CNs) and what to do when CND is diagnosed. <b>Design</b>  A 14-year period observational, retrospective cohort study. <b>Setting</b>  Level-I trauma center study. <b>Participants</b>  All 119 surviving cases admitted with an OCF, whereof all 40 cases with either diagnosed CND (confirmed by clinical examination) or expected CND (reported observations high suspicious for CND) were selected for detailed data collection. Early death was the only exclusion criterion because of missing data and clinical irrelevance. <b>Main Outcome Measures</b>  One-third of all surviving OCF patients have CND ( <i>n</i>  = 40/119, 33.6%), where three-quarters had more than one CN affected with a median of three CNs. Of the cases with a concomitant lateral skull base fracture ( <i>n</i>  = 24/40, 60%), one in three cases (36%, <i>n</i>  = 13/36) had facial nerve palsy and nearly two in three cases (61%, <i>n</i>  = 22/36) had hearing loss. <b>Results</b>  The facial nerve was the most commonly diagnosed CND. Solitary OCF cases often had lower CND ( <i>n</i>  = 11/14). Fifty-eight percent of all CND cases with follow-up data ( <i>n</i>  = 19/33)-corresponding to one in six of all surviving OCF cases-had chronic CND sequelae. <b>Conclusion</b>  Multiple and chronic CND is common in patients with an OCF. All CNs should be tested in those patients as soon as clinically possible, and testing should be repeated after 3 to 7 days and before discharge. Patients with CND should be counseled about their prognosis and be potentially referred to (e.g.) a speech and language therapist, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or otorhinolaryngologist for early treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Parents play a key role in their child's early development but evidence that parental engagement strategies are effective is unclear. The current study evaluated a parent-delivered early language teaching programme that aimed to support children's early language and literacy skills. A multisite, pupil-level randomised controlled trial was conducted with 450 3-4-year-old children and their families, recruited from 47 nurseries across Greater Manchester and Lancashire (UK). Families were randomly allocated to either the programme group (<i>N</i> = 225) who delivered an early language teaching programme for 20-min a day, 5 days a week, for 30-weeks or to a control group (<i>N</i> = 225) who received a box of children's books at the end of nursery. A language latent variable formed the primary outcome, which was used to assess whether the programme improved children's language and literacy skills. COVID-19 disrupted the trial, including delivery of the intervention and post-test data collection. Data from assessments completed 10-months after intervention showed no evidence that the children receiving language intervention had greater language skills than the control group. Similarly, no group differences were found on measures of the Home Learning Environment or school readiness. Whilst disruptions caused by COVID-19 are likely to have impacted on the findings, this study nonetheless adds to the literature which suggests that parent-delivered interventions alone may not necessarily lead to changes in home learning or to gains in children's language skills.",

    "abstract": "We report high-resolution angular diffraction measurements of CH<sub>4</sub> and Ne from Ni(111) and from a graphene (Gr) layer grown on Ni(111), whose effective atomic mass is enhanced by the strong Gr-Ni interaction. The incident energies are between 43 and 68 meV for Ne, and between 62 and 108 meV for CH<sub>4</sub> beams. Sharp diffraction features are observed with Ne beams from both Ni(111) and Gr/Ni(111) surfaces. However, using methane beams, clear diffraction peaks are observed only from Ni(111), with broad angular distributions measured from Gr/Ni(111), as expected for classical particles, with no quantum features. This is surprising, since Ne and methane have similar masses and therefore a comparable quantum behavior is expected for the same incident energy. This effect is mainly due to the larger physisorption well of CH<sub>4</sub> on Gr/Ni(111), as shown by DFT calculations, in addition to the larger corrugation of the potential energy surface and the excitation of phonon modes of the graphene overlayer.",

    "abstract": "Newcastle disease in avian species is caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV). It is responsible for large economic losses to the poultry industry. The early diagnosis of NDV infection is important for epidemiologic control and clinical management. The present study aimed to develop reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR) assay that accurately detects the NDV at isothermal temperature. The RT-PSR assay was developed using specifically designed primers targeting the conserved fusion gene of NDV. The assay could be performed within 2 h at an isothermal temperature of 65 °C. The developed assay is highly sensitive and capable to detect as low as 1.08 fg of template. It was found to be 1000-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and was comparable to real-time RT-PCR assay. The developed assay was found to be specific as it did not detect closely related infectious bronchitis virus and Merck disease virus. Further, the developed assay was evaluated with clinical samples and it has shown > 99% concordance with RT-PCR methods. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of isothermal detection of NDV without the need of high-end equipment like thermal cycler. Moreover, this assay has the potential to detect NDV under field conditions. In conclusions, the results of this study indicated that the RT-PSR assay is a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific assay for the detection of NDV that may improve diagnostic potential in clinical laboratories or can be used at diagnostic laboratories with the least infrastructure or even at field condition.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Bayesian Integrated Modeling of Age- and Sex-Structured Wildlife Population Dynamics.",
    "abstract": "Biodiversity of large wild mammals is declining at alarming rates worldwide. It is therefore imperative to develop effective population conservation and recovery strategies. Population dynamics models can provide insights into processes driving declines of particular populations of a species and their relative importance. But there are insufficient tools, namely population dynamics models for wild herbivores, for characterizing their decline and for guiding conservation and management actions. Therefore, we have developed a model which can serve as a tool to fill that void. Specifically, we develop an integrated Bayesian state-space population dynamics model for wildlife populations and illustrate it using a topi population inhabiting the Greater Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem in Kenya and Tanzania. The model integrates ground demographic survey with aerial survey monitoring data. It incorporates population age and sex structure and life history traits and strategies and relates birth rates, age-specific survival rates and sex ratios with meteorological covariates, prior population density, environmental seasonality and predation risk. It runs on a monthly time step, enabling accurate characterization of reproductive seasonality, phenology, synchrony and prolificacy of births, juvenile and adult recruitments. Model performance is evaluated using balanced bootstrap sampling and by comparing model predictions with empirical aerial population size estimates. The hierarchical Bayesian model is implemented using MCMC methods for parameter estimation, prediction and inference and reproduces several well-known features of the Mara topi population, including striking and persistent population decline, seasonality of births, juvenile and adult recruitments. It is general and can be readily adapted for other wildlife species and extended to incorporate several additional useful features. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.

However, empirical assessments of how such personnel changes relate to party behavior are rare. We explore personnel renewal in the party executive as a driver of party policy change and argue that focusing on these processes provides for an encompassing perspective on the connection between intra-party power and party behavior. Building on the party change literature, we theorize on personnel renewal in the party executive as a potential stand-alone driver of party policy change as well as on its interplay with other explanatory factors and test empirical implications based on all major Austrian parties (1949-2019). Findings suggest that personnel renewal in the party executive has a profound effect on party policy and that these personnel changes are in part driven by party performance.",

A neuroprotective compound, ACTH <sub>4-10</sub>Pro <sup>8</sup>-Gly <sup>9</sup>-Pro <sup>10</sup> (ACTH <sub>4-10</sub>) also known as semax, has shown neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. ACTH <sub>4-10</sub> has also been actively used in the treatment of brain ischemia without serious complication reported. Here, we analyzed the effects of ACTH <sub>4-10</sub> at regulating the inflammatory cascade in SCI by looking at anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13) levels after acute SCI. We carried out laminectomies in male Sprague Dawley rats at the second thoracic vertebrae. After laminectomy, we exposed the myelum and created mild SCI models with 20-g, and severe SCI with 35-g aneurysm clips. ACTH <sub>4-10</sub> was administered intranasally to the treatment group and 0.9% NaCl to the control group (placebo). Both groups were kept alive and terminated at 3 and 6 hours. The tissue sample preparations were fixed in formalin and examined for immunohistochemistry. Quantitative measurement of the cytokines was done in the posterior horn area with specific associated anti-monoclonal antibodies. Rats with mild SCI that were given ACTH <sub>4-10</sub> showed greater anti-inflammatory levels at 3 hours post-compression but only IL-10 and IL-13 were elevated significantly at 6 hours. Rats with severe compression in ACTH <sub>4-10</sub> group showed greater levels of IL-10, IL-13 at 3 hours and IL-4, IL-10 at 6 hours compared with the placebo group. Administration of ACTH <sub>4-10</sub>Pro <sup>8</sup>-Gly <sup>9</sup>-Pro <sup>10</sup> intranasal can increase anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in Sprague Dawley rat models with mild and severe SCI. Expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines was greater in mild compression and 3-hour termination. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and clinical outcome <i>in vivo.</i>",

    "abstract": "Whereas improved full immunization coverage for childhood vaccines have been witnessed globally in the past decades, countries in sub-Saharan Africa have registered slow progress, with variations between and within countries. This has been attributed to several challenges/vulnerability factors. However, lacking is a documentation of how governments are conceptualizing and addressing these vulnerabilities. We therefore plan to systematically review policy documents to examine the extent to which vulnerability issues are framed and addressed in the general health sector and immunization policy documents in Kenya. The review will focus on the general health sector and immunization policy documents covering the period between 2000 and 2023. Documents in the English language will be reviewed. Data sources will include official Ministry of Health website, websites of key international organizations working on immunization, checking reference lists of already identified documents, general Google searches and requesting relevant documents from stakeholders and officials. Data synthesis will follow a deductive and inductive approach. Findings will be presented in a descriptive format according to the review objectives. We will assess the extent to which vulnerability issues are included and how they are defined in the general health sector and immunization policy documents. In addition, the review will examine strategies proposed, planned and/or implemented to promote access and uptake of immunization services in Kenya.",

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of Christian schools in Japan, Christians account for only 1.6% of the nation's population. In the attempt to explore this inconsistency, we conducted an online survey in January 2020 to those between the ages of 15 and 29 living in Tokyo and Kanagawa. Our subjects include those who have enrolled in Christian schools, those who have some sort of affiliation, and those who do not have affiliation. We attempted to measure the difference in attitude by the degree of their affiliation. We focused on the notion of triple faith which was proposed by Inoue and others. Many people in Japan believe in both Buddhism and Shintoism because neither requires a rite such as baptism. Christianity requires baptism, but that aside, in practice, many Japanese have triple faith including Christianity. Prosperity of Christian schools, tolerance towards Christmas, and popularity of Christian-style weddings all testify to this. This argument by Inoue and others conflicts with the common belief that Christianity never got a foothold in Japan. The results of cross tabulation of key questions and affiliation with Christian schools, combined with our interview results, show that those who have enrolled in Christian schools are more likely to have what may be referred to as triple faith. We have also provided a discussion on the possible reasons behind this finding.",

Combining the Inventory of Problems-29 (IOP-29, an SVT) with its Memory module (IOP-M, a PVT), referred to here as 'IOP-29-M', may be especially beneficial, as it allows for rapid assessment of both symptom and performance validity. Accordingly, the present study aimed at 'stress testing' the IOP-29-M by examining base rates of failure (BR<sub>Fail</sub>) in 109 patients with schizophrenia spectrum psychopathology, both with and without criminal convictions. In the overall sample, BR<sub>Fail</sub> were low: 13.8% and 8.3%, respectively, for the standard (≥ .50) and conservative (≥ .65) cutoffs of the IOP-29, and 12.8% and 9.2%, respectively, for the standard (≤ 29) and conservative (≤ 28) cutoffs of the IOP-M.

    "abstract": "Risk assessment and evaluation before behavioral assessment and intervention is required by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board® (BACB®) Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts (BACB, 2020). Methods to do so and potential factors to consider are not readily available. Deochand et al. <i>Behavior Analysis in Practice</i>, <i>13</i>, 978-990, (2020) developed the Functional Analysis Risk Assessment Decision Tool (FARADT) to aid behavior analysts in ethical decision-making regarding whether to conduct a functional analysis. An empirical evaluation of whether use of the FARADT impacts novice users' ratings of risk has not yet been conducted. The present study served as a pilot evaluation of expert and novice behavior analysts' ratings of risk with and without access to the FARADT when given scenarios in which a functional analysis was being considered. Results indicated that for our participants, FARADT decreased variability of risk ratings for novices and produced ratings of risk that more closely matched the intended risk level of the vignette for both experts and novices. Results provided preliminary evidence that decision-making tools may be helpful to both novice and expert behavior analysts.In order to be in compliance with the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts (Behavior Analyst Certification Board® [BACB®], 2020), it is important that behavior analysts are evaluating risks associated with functional analyses prior to beginning assessment.The FARADT is a tool that may be helpful to both expert and novice behavior analysts as they evaluate the risks inherent in functional analyses.There is limited empirical research on the utility and effectiveness of behavior-analytic decision-making tools.Our findings suggest experts engage in complex covert verbal behavior when evaluating risk.More research is needed on the decision-making processes experts utilize when analyzing complex and nuanced contexts of assessment and treatment.

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>  Nasoseptal flaps (NSF), perfused by the posterior septal artery (PSA), are heavily utilized in endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS). We use indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography to assess PSA perfusion. <b>Methods</b>  A prospective study of adult ESBS patients assessed PSA perfusion using intraoperative ICG. PSA ICG fluorescence intensities (FIs) were quantified. Factors analyzed included demographics, comorbidities, prior sinonasal surgery, surgical approach, concurrent septoplasty, NSF harvest timing, and flap-related complications. <i>t</i> -Tests compared significant ICG baseline differences and changes from baseline. ICG enhancement was compared with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <b>Results</b>  A total of 54 patients were studied. Of these, 35 NSFs were harvested, while the remaining 19 underwent cuts for rescue flaps. Mean PSA FI changed from baseline 118.1 ± 28.6 to 114.4 ± 32.3 following reconstruction. Tobacco users had lower baseline FI compared with non-tobacco users (78.3 ± 62.8 vs. 118.4 ± 29.1, <i>p</i>  = 0.003). Transpterygoid approaches showed greater decrease from baseline (-25.8 ± 58.9 vs. -3.8 ± 32.1, <i>p</i>  = 0.035) than transsphenoidal. No other studied factors, including revision case, timing of flap harvest, flap side, division of palatosphenoidal artery, or concurrent septoplasty, had a significant influence on ICG intensity. In total, 34 of 35 NSFs were viable. ICG fluorescence had a 100% sensitivity, 0% specificity, and 96.6% positive predictive value (PPV) for NSF viability, while MRI enhancement had a 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 100% PPV for NSF viability. <b>Conclusion</b>  ICG angiography may provide an intraoperative assessment of flap viability with comparable PPV as postoperative MRI. Tobacco use and transpterygoid approaches may be associated with decreased PSA perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, contributing to global mortality and disability. Approximately 30% of Indian adults are diagnosed with hypertension. Evidence supports that self-monitoring and blood pressure self-management can lower systolic BP by an average of 3.2 mmHg. mHealth applications facilitate remote monitoring and self-management, yet existing applications in India lack customisation for user needs, limiting their usability. This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel, user-friendly mHealth application tailored to hypertensive individuals. This study follows an Agile development design, an iterative software development approach that allows continuous feedback and refinement. The research will be conducted in three phases over an anticipated duration of 48 months. Phase 1 (12 months) will involve in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to identify essential features for a customised Android-based mHealth application. Phase 2 (12 months) will involve developing the application using Android Studio following Agile principles. Phase 3 (18 months) will be a community-based cluster randomised trial conducted in 12 villages to evaluate the application's effectiveness. Villages will be randomised into intervention and control groups. Each group will include 118 participants. The intervention group will use the mHealth application, while the control group will follow the standard hypertension management regimen. Villages and participants will be selected based on specific criteria, including population size, availability of healthcare facilities, and smartphone accessibility among hypertensive patients. In the proposed study, if the intervention is helpful, hypertension patients in the community can be encouraged to use the mHealth application. If found effective, this application is anticipated to improve hypertensive patients' health status, knowledge, and self-care approach.Registration: Clinical Trials Registry - India <b>( CTRI/2022/03/041544).</b>",

    "title": "Integrating post-event very high resolution SAR imagery and machine learning for building-level earthquake damage assessment.",
    "abstract": "Earthquakes have devastating effects on densely urbanised regions, requiring rapid and extensive damage assessment to guide resource allocation and recovery efforts. Traditional damage assessment is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and faces challenges in covering vast affected areas, often limiting timely decision-making. Space-borne synthetic aperture radars (SAR) have gained attention for their all-weather and day-night imaging capabilities. These advantages, coupled with wide coverage, short revisits and very high resolution (VHR), have created opportunities for using SAR data in disaster response. However, most SAR studies for post-earthquake damage assessment rely on change detection methods using pre-event SAR images, which are often unavailable in operational scenarios. Limited studies using solely post-event SAR data primarily concentrate on city-block-level damage assessment, thus not fully exploiting the VHR SAR potential. This paper presents a novel method integrating solely post-event VHR SAR imagery and machine learning (ML) for regional-scale post-earthquake damage assessment at the individual building-level. We first used supervised learning on case-specific datasets, and then introduced a combined learning approach, incorporating inventories from multiple case studies to assess generalisation. Finally, the ML model was tested on unseen study areas, to evaluate its flexibility in unfamiliar contexts. The method was implemented using datasets collected during the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT) reconnaissance missions following the 2021 Nippes earthquake and the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake sequence. The results demonstrate the method's ability to classify standing and collapsed buildings, achieving up to 72% overall accuracy on unseen regions. The proposed method has potential for future disaster assessments, thereby contributing to more effective earthquake management strategies.

We used data from the Sulcovid-19, a longitudinal study carried out with individuals who had COVID-19. Overall, 2,919 participants were asked if they attended any health care services after COVID-19 infection. We asked participants about medical diagnosis of systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), diabetes mellitus (DM), respiratory diseases (RD), and heart diseases (HD). We used poisson regression to assess the association between health care utilization and NCDs. Having a NCD was associated with an increased likelihood of using urgent and emergency services (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.67, 95%CI 1.33; 2.11). An increased use of specialized services (i.e., cardiologist) is highlighted among individuals with at least one NCD (PR 3.77, 95%CI 2.97; 4.80), SAH (PR 3.47, 95%CI 2.97; 4.31), and DM (PR 3.87, 95%CI 3.11; 4.81).

    "abstract": "The attribution of responsibility is an important aspect of democratic government and governance. This study is interested in explaining variation in the responsibility that the public attributes to farmers for tackling climate change and environmental degradation. It analyzes data for respondents based in the 27 member states of the European Union as offered by a special issue of the Eurobarometer. Theoretically, the study postulates that if individuals perceive agriculture as a cause of climate change and environmental degradation, then they are more likely to indicate that it is a responsibility of farmers to take environmental and climate action. It also hypothesizes that individuals with a left-leaning ideology are more likely to attribute responsibility to farmers than right-leaning ones. Empirically, we find that the attribution of responsibility to farmers for mitigating climate change and environmental degradation is highest among Danes and lowest among Estonians. In 19 out of the 27 member states, our hypothesis holds true that individuals who perceive agriculture as a cause of climate change and environmental degradation are also more likely to attribute farmers' responsibility for taking climate and environmental action. And in 11 member states, left-leaning individuals have a significantly higher likelihood of attributing farmers' responsibility for tackling climate change and environmental degradation.",

    "title": "Exposing State Repression: Digital Discursive Contention by Chinese Protestors.",
    "abstract": "One of the major issues in international development is how disadvantaged populations mobilize in response to state repression. Whether in the Black Lives Movement or in the 2011 Arab Spring, digital exposures of police abuse have spurred social movements when people took to social media to expose it. Yet, in authoritarian regimes, citizens cannot easily initiate or participate in social movements. In such cases, how do victims of police violence express their dissatisfaction? This study examines this question in contemporary China, where repression of protesters is well documented. Based on a dataset of microblogs-Chinese tweets-documenting 74,415 protest events in the early Xi administration (2013-2016), this study analyzes how ordinary protestors, including migrant workers, peasants, and the urban poor, expose police abuse in social media. A close reading of microblogs documenting 150 randomly sampled events finds that Chinese protestors adopt three distinct narrative types: citizenship, solidarity, and confrontational. An accompanying quantitative analysis of the wider dataset further finds that ordinary protestors frequently expose police abuse online and that mentions of police abuse are closely associated with the above three narratives. Overall, this study contributes to understanding how abused protestors discursively contest authorities in the world's most powerful authoritarian regime.",

    "abstract": "Three different series of amino acid side-chain functionalized homopolypeptides were prepared as variants of previously reported α-helical, coacervate-forming cationic polypeptides. Studies of the physical behavior of these polypeptides in aqueous media in the presence of multivalent counterions enabled a better understanding of the molecular requirements for coacervate formation of side-chain functionalized homopolypeptides. Variation in lengths of side-chain amino acid or linker segments in cationic α-helical polypeptides was found either to prohibit coacervate formation or to allow adjustment of the phase transition temperature. A series of charge-reversed, anionic amino acid side-chain functionalized homopolypeptides were also prepared and found to be α-helical and able to form coacervates similar to analogous cationic homopolypeptides. These results illustrate the ability to predictably tune coacervation properties via molecular adjustment of side-chains in homopolypeptides and show that amino acid side-chain functionalized homopolypeptides can be used as a general platform for development of biomimetic, coacervate-forming polymers.",

To begin, we offer a detailed account of the quantitative data sources, measures, and analytical strategies that have been developed by scholars studying IIPs over the last two decades. We then highlight this scholarship's important advances toward identifying IIPs' intended, unintended, and spillover effects on immigrant and non-immigrant populations in the U.S. To conclude, we discuss ongoing challenges and future opportunities for deepening research on U.S. IIPs and their psychosocial, behavioral, and health implications. Our review illuminates how data on federal immigration enforcement activities, and on federal, state, and municipal immigrant laws have engendered increasingly sophisticated quantitative studies of the U.S. IIP climate. At the same time, it highlights several dimensions in which existing work stands to be strengthened, including the need for comparisons of newly developed IIP measures and their estimated effects; greater exploration of IIPs' potentially heterogeneous effects across distinct subpopulations; and more attention to endogeneity, or in other words, the political and demographic processes that give rise to non-random variation in how IIPs take shape across space and time.",

    "abstract": "Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals face substantial barriers to health equity, which are magnified for TGD persons of color and those living in medically underserved areas. This article presents the development and pilot of an interdisciplinary health education program for TGD individuals in an underserved U.S./Mexico border community. Feasibility of the initiative and challenges of implementing such a program are discussed. A health education program was developed and piloted through a collaboration between The University of Texas at El Paso and a community partner, Borderland Rainbow Center. The program trained graduate students from various health sciences to educate TGD community members, along with their friends, families, and allies, on gender-affirming care and resources. The program took place in El Paso, TX and southern NM, USA between March and October, 2023. Examples of quantitative and qualitative data that were collected from this pilot program are provided. We present descriptive statistics of pre- versus post-survey data as a demonstration of feasibility and as an example of how such data may be structured in future studies that aim to incorporate more robust statistical analysis. The details of the program's conceptualization and implementation can serve as a model for developing targeted health education interventions for TGD populations in diverse geographic and sociocultural settings. These interventions are critical as they address both community needs and student education to combat health inequities faced by underrepresented or marginalized groups.",

    "title": "Petrification in Contemporary Set Theory: The Multiverse and the Later Wittgenstein.",
    "abstract": "This paper has two aims. First, we argue that Wittgenstein's notion of petrification can be used to explain phenomena in advanced mathematics, sometimes better than more popular views on mathematics, such as formalism, even though petrification usually suffers from a diet of examples of a very basic nature (in particular a focus on addition of small numbers). Second, we analyse current disagreements on the absolute undecidability of CH under the notion of petrification and hinge epistemology. We argue that in contemporary set theory the usage of construction techniques for set-theoretic models in which the Continuum Hypothesis holds and those in which it fails have petrified into the normative demand that CH remain undecidable. That is, the continuous and successful practices involving the construction of various set-theoretic models now act as a normative hinge shared among practitioners, i.e., have normative force in the discipline. However, not all hinges are universal, which is why we find disagreements in set theory. We will show that this is a refinement of, and partially conflicts with, the arguments presented by set theorist Joel David Hamkins.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated police officers' perceptions of a new training program aimed at improving interviewing skills for adult interviewees. Drawing from successful strategies used in interviewing child complainants of abuse, the program focused on enhancing the use of open-ended questions. The investigation aimed to identify effective aspects, limitations, the practicality of open-ended questions in real-world scenarios, and avenues for enhancing post-training interviewer performance. Through diverse qualitative data collection methods including email feedback, discussion boards, questionnaires, and follow-up interviews, officers' feedback was thematically analysed. Four key themes emerged: the utility of open-ended questions, improved skills due to course content, variability in narrative detail needs across contexts, and opportunities for enhancing learning outcomes. These findings have implications for both research and practical applications, highlighting the effectiveness of the training program and suggesting areas for further improvement in enhancing police officers' interviewing skills with adults.",

    "title": "The Feasibility of Ecological Momentary Assessment for Assessing Intimate Partner Violence in College Students with a History of Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration.",
    "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem among college students. However, few studies have used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine IPV, and instead have relied on methods that introduce recall bias (e.g., cross-sectional methods, daily diary). Thus, this study examined the feasibility of EMA to assess IPV among college students aged 18-25. A sample of 164 college students (18-25 years old, 62.8% women) in a dating relationship with a recent history of IPV perpetration completed one morning and four randomly prompted surveys daily for 28 days. Findings demonstrated high compliance (89.57% for morning and 73.49% for random surveys) with EMA surveys. The prevalence of psychological, physical, and sexual IPV reported on randomly prompted surveys was higher relative to morning surveys. The number of reported IPV instances was higher during the first half of sampling (i.e., first 14 days) compared to the last half of sampling (i.e., days 15-28). Finally, participants reported an overall neutral reaction to EMA methods, despite some technological challenges. EMA is a feasible method for assessing events of IPV in college students. The reduction of recall bias afforded with EMA methods could bring more accurate examination of prevalence and proximal risk factors for IPV. Intervention approaches could benefit from harnessing EMA methods to bring interventions to the moment they are needed among those who experience IPV.",

    "abstract": "Non-technical skills (NTS) training of surgical staff is a quality improvement measure to improve patient safety. One factor that can compromise patient safety is impaired staff performance due to stressors such as tiredness. Awareness of the impact of such stressors is measured by the stress recognition (SR) domain of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ). The aim of this study was to assess whether NTS training improves SR scores and whether there are any groups with divergent SR scores. A cross-sectional survey of all operating theatre staff in a German major trauma centre was undertaken using the stress recognition (SR) subscale of the SAQ. A multivariable linear regression was performed to assess which factors are associated with SR scores. Data are presented as median (interquartile range). From 226 invited staff members, 89 responses (39 %) were received. Twenty-eight respondents (31 %) had attended NTS training. The overall SR score was 4.3 (3.5-4.5). There was no effect of NTS training, age, gender, profession, or specialty on SR scores. Physicians in leadership positions had lower SR scores (3.4 (3.06-4.0)) than physicians without leadership positions (4.5 (4.3-5.0), p<0.001). Attendance at NTS training courses did not improve SR scores in the clinical staff of operating theatres of a German major trauma centre. Interestingly, physicians in leadership positions had lower SR scores than other physicians. Further studies using the SAQ should discriminate between physicians in leadership positions and other physicians when reporting SR scores.",

We found that competition was associated with higher quality ratings and a higher probability to achieve a five-star rating-the highest tier in the QRIS. More competition increased providers' probability to improve their rating and reduced the time to improve. Compared to public schools, private providers were responsive to competition. However, we did not find any effects of competition on district-level student third-grade academic performance.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted with 3,051 nurses in the state of São Paulo. Participants answered a questionnaire on individual characteristics, working conditions, and WAI. Validity was assessed through discriminative analysis of known groups and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with parallel analysis (PA). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients. In the analysis of known groups, all investigated individual and work variables showed statistically significant associations with WAI (p < 0.005). EFA revealed a unidimensional structure, which was confirmed by PA. The model proved to be appropriate (root mean square error of approximation = 0.125; Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.900), although the Comparative Fit Index = 0.882 was slightly lower than expected. Reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.787 and McDonald's omega = 0.819). The WAI continues to be a valid and reliable measure to evaluate work ability in the current context of Brazilian work.",

Data on firesetting location (at-home or away-from-home) of adolescents (aged 12-18 years), referred to a fire-awareness intervention programme (<i>N</i> = 2696), were analysed using chi-square and logistic regression. Characteristics of the 'at-home' group (93% male; mean age 13.5 years) included setting a fire alone; a history of misusing fire; a history of a psychiatric diagnosis; no history of offending; firesetting motivated by experimentation; and identifying as non-Māori/non-Pacific. Conversely, the 'away-from-home' group (88% male, <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 13.8 years) were predicted by firesetting with peers; this being their first misuse of fire; negative feelings (fear, shame) after the fire; an offending history; firesetting motivated by peer pressure; and identifying as Māori or Pacific.

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates rigorously that an at-scale government training program for secondary teachers in Nepal had little or no impact on student learning. It then documents five sets of weaknesses related to training uptake, training-session management, teacher subject knowledge, teacher adoption of new classroom practices, and student knowledge of earlier-grade curriculum content, each of which plausibly explains some, but not all, of the program's failure. While weaknesses in trainer and teacher motivation may have contributed to the program's disappointing performance, the study argues that time, resource, and capacity constraints of both trainers and teachers, and a mismatch between policy design and student learning needs, also limited program success. These results highlight the need to broaden common accountability-focused conceptions of how to improve public service quality.",

    "abstract": "We consider a homogeneous Bose gas in the Gross-Pitaevskii limit at temperatures that are comparable to the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation. Recently, an upper bound for the grand canonical free energy was proved in Boccato et al. (SIAM J Math Anal 56(2):2611-2660, 2024) capturing two novel contributions. First, the free energy of the interacting condensate is given in terms of an effective theory describing the probability distribution of the number of condensed particles. Second, the free energy of the thermally excited particles equals that of a temperature-dependent Bogoliubov Hamiltonian. We extend this result to a more general class of interaction potentials, including interactions with a hard core. Our proof follows a different approach than the one in Boccato et al. (SIAM J Math Anal 56(2):2611-2660, 2024): We model microscopic correlations between the particles by a Jastrow factor and exploit a cancellation in the computation of the energy that emerges due to the different length scales in the system.",

    "abstract": "The bilateral sagittal split osteotomy is a crucial aid in the correction of dentofacial abnormalities. The technique has been in practice since the late 1800s. In 2007, a study was published, in which the author performed bilateral sagittal split osteotomy on 26 patients with severe skeletal malocclusion. The article aims in displaying the follow-up of previous study at the intervals of three months, six months, one year, two years, three years, four years, five years using objective assessment of neurosensory responses. Preoperatively the anatomic location of inferior alveolar nerve was estimated using CT scans, the information derived from it was used intraoperatively, due to which the author and his team were successful to avoid damage to the inferior alveolar nerve during the procedure, hence reducing the risk of postoperative paresthesia. The article concludes by providing that preoperative evaluation of the anatomic location of the inferior alveolar nerve via CT scan, has helped to preserve inferior alveolar nerve completely during the surgery, thus displaying postoperative paresthesia in all the subjects of the study for as long as five years.",
